# With an uncomfortable tie-in, it does several things:
# 1. creates the final directory structure.
# 2. restructures the flatly structured ladder files into a language-pair based structure.
# 3. gets rid of the unreliable quality values in the ladder files. (cut -f1,2)
# 4. makes the final filenames as simple as possible,
#    from flat/ladder/89/033089.ES.LT.ladder to final/aligns/ES-LT/033089
