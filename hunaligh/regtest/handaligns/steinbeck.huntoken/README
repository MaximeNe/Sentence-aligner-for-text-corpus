Notes for users:

John Steinbeck's "Cup of Gold". Raw data obtained from the Hungarian Electronic Library and Project Gutenberg.

Sentence-level segmentation and paragraph-information by our huntoken tool. (Note: Unedited by hand, so not perfect at all.)

Although it strictly respects this imperfect sentence-level segmentation, the alignment itself is hand-edited, and should be error-free. 
It was built at the Department of Corpus Linguistics at the Hungarian Research Institute for Linguistics.

.sen files contain the sentence-level information. Paragraph structure is described by paragraph-delimiter quasi-sentences.

.pre files contain an automatically processed version of these, for aligner consumption.
Processing steps are: rude tokenization, lowercasing, stemming by the hunstem tool with Hungarian and English resources.
