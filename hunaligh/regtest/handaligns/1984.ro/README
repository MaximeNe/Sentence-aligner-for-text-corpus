Notes for users:

Data obtained from the English-Romanian parallel Multext-East "1984" corpus.

Note: The Romanian files are named hu.* , to make life easier for our scripts. We apologize for this approach. :) Basically, "hu" is a codeword for "source language" and "en" is a codeword for "target language".

.sen files contain the token-level information of that corpus, not including stem information and paragraph structure.

Encoding is ISO Latin 2.

.pre files contain versions of the sen files with some very crude tokenization, and with punctuation marks deleted.
