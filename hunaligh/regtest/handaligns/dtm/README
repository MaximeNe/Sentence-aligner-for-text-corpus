Notes for users:


From Diplomacy and Trade Magazine. (I'm not exactly sure what part of which issue, exactly.)

We are grateful to the original copyright holder for the raw data.

Sentence-level segmentation and manual alignment built at the 
Department of Corpus Linguistics at the Hungarian Research Institute for Linguistics.

.sen files contain the sentence-level information.

.pre files contain an automatically processed version of these, for aligner consumption.
Processing steps are: rude tokenization and stemming by the hunstem tool with Hungarian and English resources.

hand.ladder is the manual align of the bitext.

Notes for Hunglish developers:

Based on the text format align ./dtm.bi

See ../steinbeck/README for details on the text to .sen,.ladder conversion.

The .pre files were built like this:

export BINDIR=/home/daniel/Bicorpus/scripts
cat hu.sen | $BINDIR/tok.one.sh | $BINDIR/hu.stem.one.sh > hu.pre
cat en.sen | $BINDIR/tok.one.sh | $BINDIR/en.stem.one.sh > en.pre
