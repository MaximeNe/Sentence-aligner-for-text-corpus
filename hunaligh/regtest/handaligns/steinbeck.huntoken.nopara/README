Notes for users:

John Steinbeck's "Cup of Gold". Raw data obtained from the Hungarian Electronic Library and Project Gutenberg.

.sen files contain the sentence-level information. Sentence-level segmentation by our huntoken tool. (Note: Unedited by hand, so not perfect at all.)

Although it strictly respects this imperfect sentence-level segmentation, the alignment itself is hand-edited, and should be error-free.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This directory contains the same data as steinbeck.huntoken, with just one difference: This corpus was built by throwing away all the (automatically obtained) paragraph information from the steinbeck.huntoken corpus.

.pre files contain an automatically processed version of the .sen files, for aligner consumption.
Processing steps are: rude tokenization, lowercasing, stemming by the hunstem tool with Hungarian and English resources.
