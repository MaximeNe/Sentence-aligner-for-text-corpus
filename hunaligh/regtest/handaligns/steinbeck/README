Notes for users:

John Steinbeck's "Cup of Gold". Raw data obtained from the Hungarian Electronic Library and Project Gutenberg.

Sentence-level segmentation and paragraph-information was hand-edited at the 
Department of Corpus Linguistics at the Hungarian Research Institute for Linguistics.

.sen files contain the sentence-level information. Paragraph structure is described by paragraph-delimiter quasi-sentences.

.pre files contain an automatically processed version of these, for aligner consumption.
Processing steps are: rude tokenization and stemming by the hunstem tool with Hungarian and English resources.

auto.ladder was built by hunalign from hu.pre and en.pre, with default arguments.

hand.ladder is the manual align of the bitext, also by the
Department of Corpus Linguistics at the Hungarian Research Institute for Linguistics.
It is based on auto.ladder.

, but some whitespaces were retroactively removed, based on the text version of the manaual align:
cat align.hand.txt | cut -f1 | awk 'BEGIN {FS=" ~~~ "} { for (i=1;i<=NF;++i) { print $(i) } }' | grep -v "^$" | sed "s/ $//" | sed "s/^ //" > hu.sen.hand

The text to ladder conversion script used:
