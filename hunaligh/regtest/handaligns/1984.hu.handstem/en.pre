it be a bright cold day in April and the clock be strike thirteen
Winston Smith his chin nuzzle into his breast in a effort to escape the vile wind slip quickly through the glass door of victory mansion though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter along with him
the hallway smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mat
at one end of it a coloured poster too large for indoor display have be tack to the wall
it depict simply a enormous face more than a metre wide the face of a man of about forty-five with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome feature
Winston make for the stair
it be no use try the lift
even at the best of time it be seldom work and at present the electric current be cut off during daylight hour
it be part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week
the flat be seven flight up and Winston who be thirty-nine and have a varicose ulcer above his right ankle go slowly rest several time on the way
on each landing opposite the lift-shaft the poster with the enormous face gaze from the wall
it be one of those picture which be so contrive that the eye follow you about when you move
big brother be watch you the caption beneath it run
inside the flat a fruity voice be read out a list of figure which have something to do with the production of pig-iron
the voice come from a oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which form part of the surface of the right-hand wall
Winston turn a switch and the voice sink somewhat though the word be still distinguishable
the instrument the telescreen it be call can be dim but there be no way of shut it off completely
he move over to the window a smallish frail figure the meagreness of his body merely emphasize by the blue overall which be the uniform of the party
his hair be very fair his face naturally sanguine his skin roughen by coarse soap and blunt razor blade and the cold of the winter that have just end
outside even through the shut window-pane the world look cold
down in the street little eddy of wind be whirl dust and torn paper into spiral and though the sun be shine and the sky a harsh blue there seem to be no colour in anything except the poster that be plaster everywhere
the blackmoustachio'd face gaze down from every commanding corner
there be one on the house-front immediately opposite
big brother be watch you the caption say while the dark eye look deep into Winston have own
down at streetlevel another poster tear at one corner flap fitful in the wind alternately cover and uncover the single word Ingsoc
in the far distance a helicopter skim down between the roof hover for a instant like a bluebottle and dart away again with a curving flight
it be the police patrol snoop into people have window
the patrol do not matter however
only the thought police matter
behind Winston have back the voice from the telescreen be still babble away about pig-iron and the overfulfillment of the ninth Three-Year plan
the telescreen receive and transmit simultaneously
any sound that Winston make above the level of a very low whisper will be pick up by it moreover so long as he remain within the field of vision which the metal plaque command he can be see as well as hear
there be of course no way of know whether you be be watch at any give moment
how often or on what system the thought police plug in on any individual wire be guesswork
it be even conceivable that they watch everybody all the time
but at any rate they can plug in your wire whenever they want to
you have to live do live from habit that become instinct in the assumption that every sound you make be overhear and except in darkness every movement scrutinize
Winston keep his back turn to the telescreen
it be safe though as he well know even a back can be revealing
a kilometre away the ministry of truth his place of work tower vast and white above the grimy landscape
this he think with a sort of vague distaste this be London chief city of Airstrip one itself the third most populous of the province of Oceania
he try to squeeze out some childhood memory that shall tell him whether London have always be quite like this
be there always these vista of rotting nineteenth-century house their side shore up with baulk of timber their window patch with cardboard and their roof with corrugated iron their crazy garden wall sag in all direction
and the bombed site where the plaster dust swirl in the air and the willow-herb straggle over the heap of rubble and the place where the bomb have clear a large patch and there have spring up sordid colony of wooden dwelling like chicken-house
but it be no use he can not remember nothing remain of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableau occur against no background and mostly unintelligible
ministry of truth Minitrue in Newspeak be startlingly different from any other object in sight
it be a enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soar up terrace after terrace 300 metre into the air
from where Winston stand it be just possible to read pick out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogan of the party war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
ministry of truth contain it be say three thousand room above ground level and corresponding ramification below
scatter about London there be just three other building of similar appearance and size
so completely do they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansion you can see all four of them simultaneously
they be the home of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government be divide
the ministry of truth which concern itself with news entertainment education and the fine art
the ministry of peace which concern itself with war
the ministry of love which maintain law and order
and the ministry of plenty which be responsible for economic affair
their name in Newspeak Minitrue Minipax Miniluv and Miniplenty
the ministry of love be the really frightening one
there be no window in it at all
Winston have never be inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometre of it
it be a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrate through a maze of barbed-wire entanglement steel door and hide machine-gun nest
even the street lead up to its outer barrier be roam by gorilla-faced guard in black uniform arm with jointed truncheon
Winston turn round abruptly
he have set his feature into the expression of quiet optimism which it be advisable to wear when face the telescreen
he cross the room into the tiny kitchen
by leave the ministry at this time of day he have sacrifice his lunch in the canteen and he be aware that there be no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which have get to be save for tomorrow have breakfast
he take down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label mark victory gin
it give off a sickly oily smell as of Chinese rice spirit
Winston pour out nearly a teacupful nerve himself for a shock and gulp it down like a dose of medicine
instantly his face turn scarlet and the water run out of his eye
the stuff be like nitric acid and moreover in swallow it one have the sensation of be hit on the back of the head with a rubber club
the next moment however the burning in his belly die down and the world begin to look more cheerful
he take a cigarette from a crumpled packet mark victory cigarette and incautious hold it upright whereupon the tobacco fall out on to the floor
with the next he be more successful
he go back to the living-room and sit down at a small table that stand to the left of the telescreen
from the table drawer he take out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover
for some reason the telescreen in the living-room be in a unusual position
instead of be place as be normal in the end wall where it can command the whole room it be in the long wall opposite the window
to one side of it there be a shallow alcove in which Winston be now sit and which when the flat be build have probably be intend to hold bookshelf
by sit in the alcove and keep well back Winston be able to remain outside the range of the telescreen so far as sight go
he can be hear of course but so long as he stay in his present position he can not be see
it be partly the unusual geography of the room that have suggest to him the thing that he be now about to do
but it have also be suggest by the book that he have just take out of the drawer
it be a peculiarly beautiful book
its smooth creamy paper a little yellow by age be of a kind that have not be manufacture for at least forty year past
he can guess however that the book be much old than that
he have see it lie in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town just what quarter he do not now remember and have be strike immediately by a overwhelming desire to possess it
party member be suppose not to go into ordinary shop deal on the free market it be call but the rule be not strictly keep because there be various thing such as shoelace and razor blade which it be impossible to get hold of in any other way
he have give a quick glance up and down the street and then have slip inside and buy the book for two dollar fifty
at the time he be not conscious of want it for any particular purpose
he have carry it guiltily home in his briefcase
even with nothing write in it it be a compromising possession
the thing that he be about to do be to open a diary
this be not illegal nothing be illegal since there be no longer any law but if detect it be reasonably certain that it will be punish by death or at least by twenty-five year in a forced labour camp
Winston fit a nib into the penholder and suck it to get the grease off
the pen be a archaic instrument seldom use even for signature and he have procure one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserve to be write on with a real nib instead of be scratch with a ink-pencil
actually he be not use to write by hand
apart from very short note it be usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which be of course impossible for his present purpose
he dip the pen into the ink and then falter for just a second
a tremor have go through his bowel
to mark the paper be the decisive act
in small clumsy letter he write
April 4th 1984
he sit back
a sense of complete helplessness have descend upon him
to begin with he do not know with any certainty that this be 1984
it must be round about that date since he be fairly sure that his age be thirty-nine and he believe that he have be born in 1944 or 1945 but it be never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two
for whom it suddenly occur to him to wonder be he write this diary
for the future for the unborn
his mind hover for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetch up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink
for the first time the magnitude of what he have undertake come home to him
how can you communicate with the future
it be of its nature impossible
either the future will resemble the present in which case it will not listen to him or it will be different from it and his predicament will be meaningless
for some time he sit gaze stupidly at the paper
the telescreen have change over to strident military music
it be curious that he seem not merely to have lose the power of express himself but even to have forget what it be that he have originally intend to say
for week past he have be make ready for this moment and it have never cross his mind that anything will be need except courage
the actual write will be easy
all he have to do be to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that have be run inside his head literally for year
at this moment however even the monologue have dry up
moreover his varicose ulcer have begin itch unbearably
he dare not scratch it because if he do so it always become inflamed
the second be tick by
he be conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight booziness cause by the gin
suddenly he begin write in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he be set down
his small but childish handwriting straggle up and down the page shed first its capital letter and finally even its full stop
April 4th 1984
last night to the flick
all war film
one very good one of a ship full of refugee be bomb somewhere in the Mediterranean
audience much amused by shot of a great huge fat man try to swim away with a helicopter after him first you see him wallow along in the water like a porpoise then you see him through the helicopter gunsights then he be full of hole and the sea round him turn pink and he sink as suddenly as though the hole have let in the water audience shout with laughter when he sink
then you see a lifeboat full of child with a helicopter hover over it
there be a middle-aged woman must have be a jewess sit up in the bow with a little boy about three year old in her arm
little boy scream with fright and hide his head between her breast as if he be try to burrow right into her and the woman put her arm round him and comfort him although she be blue with fright herself all the time cover him up as much as possible as if she think her arm can keep the bullet off him
then the helicopter plant a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat go all to matchwood
then there be a wonderful shot of a child have arm go up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have follow it up and there be a lot of applause from the party seat but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly start kick up a fuss and shout they do+not have of show it not in front of kid they do+not it be+not right not in front of kid it be+not until the police turn her out i do suppose anything happen to her nobody care what the prole say typical prole reaction they never
Winston stop write partly because he be suffer from cramp
he do not know what have make him pour out this stream of rubbish
but the curious thing be that while he be do so a totally different memory have clarify itself in his mind to the point where he almost feel equal to write it down
it be he now realize because of this other incident that he have suddenly decide to come home and begin the diary today
it have happen that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous can be say to happen
it be nearly eleven hundred and in the record department where Winston work they be drag the chair out of the cubicle and group them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for the two minute hate
Winston be just take his place in one of the middle row when two people whom he know by sight but have never speak to come unexpectedly into the room
one of them be a girl whom he often pass in the corridor
he do not know her name but he know that she work in the fiction department
presumably since he have sometimes see her with oily hand and carry a spanner she have some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machine
she be a bold-looking girl of about twenty-seven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movement
a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex league be wound several time round the waist of her overall just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hip
Winston have dislike her from the very first moment of see her
he know the reason
it be because of the atmosphere of hockey-field and cold bath and community hike and general clean-mindedness which she manage to carry about with her
he dislike nearly all woman and especially the young and pretty one
it be always the woman and above all the young one who be the most bigoted adherent of the party the swallower of slogan the amateur spy and noser-out of unorthodoxy
but this particular girl give him the impression of be more dangerous than most
once when they pass in the corridor she give him a quick sidelong glance which seem to pierce right into him and for a moment have fill him with black terror
the idea have even cross his mind that she must be a agent of the thought police
that it be true be very unlikely
still he continue to feel a peculiar uneasiness which have fear mix up in it as well as hostility whenever she be anywhere near him
the other person be a man name O'Brien a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston have only a dim idea of its nature
a momentary hush pass over the group of people round the chair as they see the black overall of a inner party member approach
O'Brien be a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face
in spite of his formidable appearance he have a certain charm of manner
he have a trick of resettle his spectacle on his nose which be curiously disarm in some indefinable way curiously civilized
it be a gesture which if anyone have still think in such term must have recall a eighteenth-century nobleman offer his snuffbox
Winston have see O'Brien perhaps a dozen time in almost as many year
he feel deeply draw to him and not solely because he be intrigue by the contrast between O'Brien have urbane manner and his prize-fighter have physique
much more it be because of a secretly held belief or perhaps not even a belief merely a hope that O'Brien have political orthodoxy be not perfect
something in his face suggest it irresistibly
and again perhaps it be not even unorthodoxy that be write in his face but simply intelligence
but at any rate he have the appearance of be a person that you can talk to if somehow you can cheat the telescreen and get him alone
Winston have never make the small effort to verify this guess indeed there be no way of do so
at this moment O'Brien glance at his wrist-watch see that it be nearly eleven hundred and evidently decide to stay in the record department until the two minute hate be over
he take a chair in the same row as Winston a couple of place away
a small sandy-haired woman who work in the next cubicle to Winston be between them
the girl with dark hair be sit immediately behind
the next moment a hideous grind speech as of some monstrous machine run without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room
it be a noise that set one have tooth on edge and bristle the hair at the back of one have neck
the hate have start
as usual the face of Emmanuel Goldstein the enemy of the people have flash on to the screen
there be hiss here and there among the audience
the little sandy-haired woman give a squeak of mingled fear and disgust
Goldstein be the renegade and backslider who once long ago how long ago nobody quite remember have be one of the leading figure of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then have engage in counter-revolutionary activity have be condemn to death and have mysteriously escape and disappear
the programme of the two minute hate vary from day to day but there be none in which Goldstein be not the principal figure
he be the primal traitor the early defiler of the party have purity
all subsequent crime against the party all treachery act of sabotage heresy deviation spring directly out of his teaching
somewhere or other he be still alive and hatch his conspiracy perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign paymaster perhaps even so it be occasionally rumour in some hiding-place in Oceania itself
Winston have diaphragm be constrict
he can never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotion
it be a lean Jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard a clever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacle be perch
it resemble the face of a sheep and the voice too have a sheep-like quality
Goldstein be deliver his usual venomous attack upon the doctrine of the party a attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child shall have be able to see through it and yet just plausible enough to fill one with a alarmed feeling that other people less level-headed than oneself must be take in by it
he be abuse big brother he be denounce the dictatorship of the party he be demand the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia he be advocate freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he be cry hysterically that the revolution have be betray and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which be a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orator of the party and even contain Newspeak word more Newspeak word indeed than any party member will normally use in real life
and all the while lest one shall be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein have specious claptrap cover behind his head on the telescreen there march the endless column of the Eurasian army row after row of solid-looking man with expressionless Asiatic face who swim up to the surface of the screen and vanish to be replace by others exactly similar
the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldier have boot form the background to Goldstein have bleating voice
before the hate have proceed for thirty second uncontrollable exclamation of rage be break out from half the people in the room
the self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it be too much to be bear besides the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produce fear and anger automatically
he be a object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia since when Oceania be at war with one of these power it be generally at peace with the other
but what be strange be that although Goldstein be hate and despise by everybody although every day and a thousand time a day on platform on the telescreen in newspaper in book his theory be refute smash ridicule hold up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they be in spite of all this his influence never seem to grow less
always there be fresh dupe wait to be seduce by him
a day never pass when spy and saboteur act under his direction be not unmask by the thought police
he be the commander of a vast shadowy army a underground network of conspirator dedicate to the overthrow of the state
the brotherhood its name be suppose to be
there be also whispered story of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresy of which Goldstein be the author and which circulate clandestinely here and there
it be a book without a title
people refer to it if at all simply as the book
but one know of such thing only through vague rumour
neither the brotherhood nor the book be a subject that any ordinary party member will mention if there be a way of avoid it
in its second minute the hate rise to a frenzy
people be leap up and down in their place and shout at the top of their voice in a effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that come from the screen
the little sandy-haired woman have turn bright pink and her mouth be open and shut like that of a landed fish
even O'Brien have heavy face be flushed
he be sit very straight in his chair his powerful chest swell and quiver as though he be stand up to the assault of a wave
the dark-haired girl behind Winston have begin cry out swine swine swine and suddenly she pick up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and fling it at the screen
it strike Goldstein have nose and bounce off the voice continue inexorably
in a lucid moment Winston find that he be shout with the others and kick his heel violently against the rung of his chair
the horrible thing about the two minute hate be not that one be obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it be impossible to avoid join in
within thirty second any pretence be always unnecessary
a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash face in with a sledge-hammer seem to flow through the whole group of people like a electric current turn one even against one have will into a grimacing screaming lunatic
and yet the rage that one feel be a abstract undirected emotion which can be switch from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
thus at one moment Winston have hatred be not turn against Goldstein at all but on the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police and at such moment his heart go out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lie
and yet the very next instant he be at one with the people about him and all that be say of Goldstein seem to him to be true
at those moment his secret loathing of big brother change into adoration and big brother seem to tower up a invincible fearless protector stand like a rock against the horde of Asia and Goldstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hang about his very existence seem like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wreck the structure of civilization
it be even possible at moment to switch one have hatred this way or that by a voluntary act
suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one wrench one have head away from the pillow in a nightmare Winston succeed in transfer his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him
vivid beautiful hallucination flash through his mind
he will flog her to death with a rubber truncheon
he will tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrow like saint Sebastian
he will ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax
better than before moreover he realize why it be that he hate her
he hate her because she be young and pretty and sexless because he want to go to bed with her and will never do so because round her sweet supple waist which seem to ask you to encircle it with your arm there be only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity
the hate rise to its climax
the voice of Goldstein have become a actual sheep have bleat and for a instant the face change into that of a sheep
then the sheep-face melt into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seem to be advance huge and terrible his sub-machine gun roar and seem to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually flinch backwards in their seat
but in the same moment draw a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melt into the face of big brother black-haired blackmoustachio'd full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almost fill up the screen
nobody hear what big brother be say
it be merely a few word of encouragement the sort of word that be utter in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restore confidence by the fact of be speak
then the face of big brother fade away again and instead the three slogan of the party stand out in bold capital war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
but the face of big brother seem to persist for several second on the screen as though the impact that it have make on everyone have eyeball be too vivid to wear off immediately
the little sandyhaired woman have fling herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her
with a tremulous murmur that sound like my saviour she extend her arm towards the screen
then she bury her face in her hand
it be apparent that she be utter a prayer
at this moment the entire group of people break into a deep slow rhythmical chant of B-B B-B B-B over and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first B and the second a heavy murmurous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seem to hear the stamp of naked foot and the throbbing of tom-tom
for perhaps as much as thirty second they keep it up
it be a refrain that be often hear in moment of overwhelming emotion
partly it be a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it be a act of self-hypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise
Winston have entrails seem to grow cold
in the two minute hate he can not help share in the general delirium but this sub-human chanting of B-B B-B always fill him with horror
of course he chant with the rest it be impossible to do otherwise
to dissemble your feeling to control your face to do what everyone else be do be a instinctive reaction
but there be a space of a couple of second during which the expression of his eye must conceivably have betray him
and it be exactly at this moment that the significant thing happen if indeed it do happen
momentarily he catch O'Brien have eye
O'Brien have stand up
he have take off his spectacle and be in the act of resettle them on his nose with his characteristic gesture
but there be a fraction of a second when their eye meet and for as long as it take to happen Winston know yes he know that O'Brien be think the same thing as himself
a unmistakable message have pass
it be as though their two mind have open and the thought be flow from one into the other through their eye
I be with you O'Brien seem to be say to him
I know precisely what you be feel
I know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust
but do+not worry I be on your side
and then the flash of intelligence be go and O'Brien have face be as inscrutable as everybody else have
that be all and he be already uncertain whether it have happen
such incident never have any sequel
all that they do be to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself be the enemy of the party
perhaps the rumour of vast underground conspiracy be true after all perhaps the brotherhood really exist
it be impossible in spite of the endless arrest and confession and execution to be sure that the brotherhood be not simply a myth
some day he believe in it some day not
there be no evidence only fleeting glimpse that must mean anything or nothing snatch of overheard conversation faint scribble on lavatory wall once even when two stranger meet a small movement of the hand which have look as though it must be a signal of recognition
it be all guesswork very likely he have imagine everything
he have go back to his cubicle without look at O'Brien again
the idea of follow up their momentary contact hardly cross his mind
it will have be inconceivably dangerous even if he have know how to set about do it
for a second two second they have exchange a equivocal glance and that be the end of the story
but even that be a memorable event in the locked loneliness in which one have to live
Winston rouse himself and sit up straight
he let out a belch
the gin be rise from his stomach
his eye re-focus on the page
he discover that while he sit helplessly muse he have also be write as though by automatic action
and it be no longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before
his pen have slide voluptuously over the smooth paper print in large neat capital down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again fill half a page
he can not help feel a twinge of panic
it be absurd since the write of those particular word be not more dangerous than the initial act of open the diary but for a moment he be tempt to tear out the spoil page and abandon the enterprise altogether
he do not do so however because he know that it be useless
whether he write down with big brother or whether he refrain from write it make no difference
whether he go on with the diary or whether he do not go on with it make no difference
the thought police will get him just the same
he have commit will still have commit even if he have never set pen to paper the essential crime that contain all others in itself
thoughtcrime they call it
thoughtcrime be not a thing that can be conceal for ever
you must dodge successfully for a while even for year but sooner or later they be bound to get you
it be always at night the arrest invariably happen at night
the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shake your shoulder the light glare in your eye the ring of hard face round the bed
in the vast majority of case there be no trial no report of the arrest
people simply disappear always during the night
your name be remove from the register every record of everything you have ever do be wipe out your one-time existence be deny and then forget
you be abolish annihilate vaporize be the usual word
for a moment he be seize by a kind of hysteria
he begin write in a hurried untidy scrawl
they+will shoot me i do+not care they+will shoot me in the back of the neck i do care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i do care down with big brother
he sit back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself and lay down the pen
the next moment he start violently
there be a knocking at the door
already
he sit as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it be must go away after a single attempt
but no the knocking be repeat
the bad thing of all will be to delay
his heart be thump like a drum but his face from long habit be probably expressionless
he get up and move heavily towards the door
as he put his hand to the door-knob Winston see that he have leave the diary open on the table
down with big brother be write all over it in letter almost big enough to be legible across the room
it be a inconceivably stupid thing to have do
but he realize even in his panic he have not want to smudge the creamy paper by shut the book while the ink be wet
he draw in his breath and open the door
instantly a warm wave of relief flow through him
a colourless crushed-looking woman with wispy hair and a lined face be stand outside
oh comrade she begin in a dreary whine sort of voice I think I hear you come in
do you think you can come across and have a look at our kitchen sink
it have get block up and
it be mrs Parsons the wife of a neighbour on the same floor
mrs be a word somewhat discountenance by the party you be supposed to call everyone comrade but with some woman one use it instinctively
she be a woman of about thirty but look much old
one have the impression that there be dust in the crease of her face
Winston follow her down the passage
these amateur repair job be a almost daily irritation
victory mansion be old flat build in 1930 or thereabouts and be fall to piece
the plaster flake constantly from ceiling and wall the pipe burst in every hard frost the roof leak whenever there be snow the heating system be usually run at half steam when it be not close down altogether from motive of economy
repair except what you can do for yourself have to be sanction by remote committee which be liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two year
of course it be only because tom be+not home say mrs Parsons vague
the Parsons have flat be big than Winston have and dingy in a different way
everything have a battered trample-on look as though the place have just be visit by some large violent animal
game impedimenta hockey-stick boxing-glove a burst football a pair of sweaty short turn inside out lie all over the floor and on the table there be a litter of dirty dish and dog-eared exercise-book
on the wall be scarlet banner of the youth league and the spy and a full-sized poster of big brother
there be the usual boiled-cabbage smell common to the whole building but it be shoot through by a sharp reek of sweat which one know this at the first sniff though it be hard to say how be the sweat of some person not present at the moment
in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper be try to keep tune with the military music which be still issue from the telescreen
it be the child say mrs Parsons cast a half-apprehensive glance at the door
they have+not be out today
and of course
she have a habit of break off her sentence in the middle
the kitchen sink be full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smell worse than ever of cabbage
Winston kneel down and examine the angle-joint of the pipe
he hate use his hand and he hate bend down which be always liable to start him cough
mrs Parsons look on helplessly
of course if tom be home he will put it right in a moment she say
he love anything like that
he be ever so good with his hand tom be
Parsons be Winston have fellow-employee at the ministry of truth
he be a fattish but active man of paralyse stupidity a mass of imbecile enthusiasm one of those completely unquestioning devoted drudge on whom more even than on the thought police the stability of the party depend
at thirty-five he have just be unwillingly evict from the youth league and before graduate into the youth league he have manage to stay on in the spy for a year beyond the statutory age
at the ministry he be employ in some subordinate post for which intelligence be not require but on the other hand he be a leading figure on the sport committee and all the other committee engage in organize community hike spontaneous demonstration saving campaign and voluntary activity generally
he will inform you with quiet pride between whiff of his pipe that he have put in a appearance at the community centre every evening for the past four year
a overpowering smell of sweat a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life follow him about wherever he go and even remain behind him after he have go
have you get a spanner
say Winston fiddle with the nut on the angle-joint
a spanner say mrs Parsons immediately become invertebrate
I do+not know I be sure
perhaps the child
there be a trample of boot and another blast on the comb as the child charge into the living-room
mrs Parsons bring the spanner
Winston let out the water and disgusted remove the clot of human hair that have block up the pipe
he clean his finger as best he can in the cold water from the tap and go back into the other room
up with your hand yell a savage voice
a handsome tough-looking boy of nine have pop up from behind the table and be menace him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sister about two year young make the same gesture with a fragment of wood
both of them be dress in the blue short grey shirt and red neckerchiefs which be the uniform of the spy
Winston raise his hand above his head but with a uneasy feeling so vicious be the boy have demeanour that it be not altogether a game
you be a traitor yell the boy
you be a thought-criminal
you be a Eurasian spy
I will shoot you I will vaporize you I will sent you to the salt mine
suddenly they be both leap round him shout traitor and thought-criminal the little girl imitate her brother in every movement
it be somehow slightly frightening like the gambol of tiger cub which will soon grow up into man-eater
there be a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy have eye a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of be very nearly big enough to do so
it be a good job it be not a real pistol he be hold Winston think
mrs Parsons have eye flit nervously from Winston to the child and back again
in the good light of the living-room he notice with interest that there actually be dust in the crease of her face
they do get so noisy she say
they be disappointed because they could+not go to see the hanging that be what it be
I be too busy to take them and tom will+not be back from work in time
why can+not we go and see the hanging
roar the boy in his huge voice
want to see the hanging
want to see the hanging chant the little girl still caper round
some Eurasian prisoner guilty of war crime be to be hang in the park that evening Winston remember
this happen about once a month and be a popular spectacle
child always clamour to be take to see it
he take his leave of mrs Parsons and make for the door
but he have not go six step down the passage when something hit the back of his neck a agonizingly painful blow
it be as though a red-hot wire have be jab into him
he spin round just in time to see mrs Parsons drag her son back into the doorway while the boy pocket a catapult
Goldstein bellow the boy as the door close on him
but what most strike Winston be the look of helpless fright on the woman have greyish face
back in the flat he step quickly past the telescreen and sit down at the table again still rub his neck
the music from the telescreen have stop
instead a clipped military voice be read out with a sort of brutal relish a description of the armament of the new floating fortress which have just be anchor between Iceland and the faroe island
with those child he think that wretched woman must lead a life of terror
another year two year and they will be watch her night and day for symptom of unorthodoxy
nearly all child nowadays be horrible
what be bad of all be that by means of such organization as the spy they be systematically turn into ungovernable little savage and yet this produce in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party
on the contrary they adore the party and everything connect with it
the song the procession the banner the hiking the drill with dummy rifle the yell of slogan the worship of big brother it be all a sort of glorious game to them
all their ferocity be turn outwards against the enemy of the state against foreigner traitor saboteur thought-criminal
it be almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own child
and with good reason for hardly a week pass in which the times do not carry a paragraph describe how some eavesdrop little sneak child hero be the phrase generally use have overhear some compromising remark and denounce its parent to the thought police
the sting of the catapult bullet have wear off
he pick up his pen half-heartedly wonder whether he can find something more to write in the diary
suddenly he begin think of O'Brien again
year ago how long be it
seven year it must be he have dream that he be walk through a pitch-dark room
and someone sit to one side of him have say as he pass we shall meet in the place where there be no darkness
it be say very quietly almost casually a statement not a command
he have walk on without pause
what be curious be that at the time in the dream the word have not make much impression on him
it be only later and by degree that they have seem to take on significance
he can not now remember whether it be before or after have the dream that he have see O'Brien for the first time nor can he remember when he have first identify the voice as O'Brien have
but at any rate the identification exist
it be O'Brien who have speak to him out of the dark
Winston have never be able to feel sure even after this morning have flash of the eye it be still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien be a friend or a enemy
nor do it even seem to matter greatly
there be a link of understanding between them more important than affection or partisanship
we shall meet in the place where there be no darkness he have say
Winston do not know what it mean only that in some way or another it will come true
the voice from the telescreen pause
a trumpet call clear and beautiful float into the stagnant air
the voice continue raspingly
attention
your attention please
a newsflash have this moment arrive from the malabar front
our force in south India have win a glorious victory
I be authorize to say that the action we be now report may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end
here be the newsflash
bad news come think Winston
and sure enough follow on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army with stupendous figure of killed and prisoner come the announcement that as from next week the chocolate ration will be reduce from thirty gramme to twenty
Winston belch again
the gin be wear off leave a deflated feeling
the telescreen perhaps to celebrate the victory perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate crash into Oceania it be for you
you be supposed to stand to attention
however in his present position he be invisible
Oceania it be for you give way to light music
Winston walk over to the window keep his back to the telescreen
the day be still cold and clear
somewhere far away a rocket bomb explode with a dull reverberate roar
about twenty or thirty of them a week be fall on London at present
down in the street the wind flap the torn poster to and fro and the word Ingsoc fitful appear and vanish
Ingsoc
the sacred principle of Ingsoc
Newspeak doublethink the mutability of the past
he feel as though he be wander in the forest of the sea bottom lose in a monstrous world where he himself be the monster
he be alone
the past be dead the future be unimaginable
what certainty have he that a single human creature now live be on his side
and what way of know that the dominion of the party will not endure for ever
like a answer the three slogan on the white face of the ministry of truth come back to him war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength he take a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket
there too in tiny clear lettering the same slogan be inscribe and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother
even from the coin the eye pursue you
on coin on stamp on the cover of book on banner on poster and on the wrapping of a cigarette packet everywhere
always the eye watch you and the voice envelop you
asleep or awake work or eat indoors or out of door in the bath or in bed no escape
nothing be your own except the few cubic centimetre inside your skull
the sun have shift round and the myriad window of the ministry of truth with the light no longer shine on them look grim as the loophole of a fortress
his heart quail before the enormous pyramidal shape
it be too strong it can not be storm
a thousand rocket bomb will not batter it down
he wonder again for whom he be write the diary
for the future for the past for a age that must be imaginary
and in front of him there lie not death but annihilation
the diary will be reduce to ash and himself to vapour
only the thought police will read what he have write before they wipe it out of existence and out of memory
how can you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you not even a anonymous word scribble on a piece of paper can physically survive
the telescreen strike fourteen
he must leave in ten minute
he have to be back at work by fourteen-thirty
curiously the chime of the hour seem to have put new heart into him
he be a lonely ghost utter a truth that nobody will ever hear
but so long as he utter it in some obscure way the continuity be not break
it be not by make yourself hear but by stay sane that you carry on the human heritage
he go back to the table dip his pen and write
to the future or to the past to a time when thought be free when man be different from one another and do not live alone to a time when truth exist and what be do cannot be undo
from the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of big brother from the age of doublethink greeting
he be already dead he reflect
it seem to him that it be only now when he have begin to be able to formulate his thought that he have take the decisive step
the consequence of every act be include in the act itself
he write
thoughtcrime do not entail death thoughtcrime be death
now he have recognize himself as a dead man it become important to stay alive as long as possible
two finger of his right hand be inkstained
it be exactly the kind of detail that must betray you
some nose zealot in the ministry a woman probably someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the fiction department must start wonder why he have be write during the lunch interval why he have use a oldfashioned pen what he have be write and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter
he go to the bathroom and carefully scrub the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasp your skin like sandpaper and be therefore well adapt for this purpose
he put the diary away in the drawer
it be quite useless to think of hide it but he can at least make sure whether or not its existence have be discover
a hair lay across the page-end be too obvious
with the tip of his finger he pick up a identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposit it on the corner of the cover where it be bound to be shake off if the book be move
Winston be dream of his mother
he must he think have be ten or eleven year old when his mother have disappear
she be a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movement and magnificent fair hair
his father he remember more vague as dark and thin dress always in neat dark clothes Winston remember especially the very thin sole of his father have shoe and wear spectacle
the two of them must evidently have be swallow up in one of the first great purge of the fifty
at this moment his mother be sit in some place deep down beneath him with his young sister in her arm
he do not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eye
both of them be look up at him
they be down in some subterranean place the bottom of a well for instance or a very deep grave but it be a place which already far below him be itself move downwards
they be in the saloon of a sink ship look up at him through the darken water
there be still air in the saloon they can still see him and he them but all the while they be sink down down into the green water which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever
he be out in the light and air while they be be suck down to death and they be down there because he be up here
he know it and they know it and he can see the knowledge in their face
there be no reproach either in their face or in their heart only the knowledge that they must die in order that he must remain alive and that this be part of the unavoidable order of thing
he can not remember what have happen but he know in his dream that in some way the life of his mother and his sister have be sacrifice to his own
it be one of those dream which while retain the characteristic dream scenery be a continuation of one have intellectual life and in which one become aware of fact and idea which still seem new and valuable after one be awake
the thing that now suddenly strike Winston be that his mother have death nearly thirty year ago have be tragic and sorrowful in a way that be no longer possible
tragedy he perceive belong to the ancient time to a time when there be still privacy love and friendship and when the member of a family stand by one another without need to know the reason
his mother have memory tear at his heart because she have die love him when he be too young and selfish to love her in return and because somehow he do not remember how she have sacrifice herself to a conception of loyalty that be private and unalterable
such thing he see can not happen today
today there be fear hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrow
all this he seem to see in the large eye of his mother and his sister look up at him through the green water hundred of fathom down and still sink
suddenly he be stand on short springy turf on a summer evening when the slanting ray of the sun gild the ground
the landscape that he be look at recur so often in his dream that he be never fully certain whether or not he have see it in the real world
in his waking thought he call it the golden country
it be a old rabbit-bitten pasture with a foot-track wander across it and a molehill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the bough of the elm tree be sway very faintly in the breeze their leaf just stir in dense mass like woman have hair
somewhere near at hand though out of sight there be a clear slow-moving stream where dace be swim in the pool under the willow tree
the girl with dark hair be come towards them across the field
with what seem a single movement she tear off her clothes and fling them disdainful aside
her body be white and smooth but it arouse no desire in him indeed he barely look at it
what overwhelm him in that instant be admiration for the gesture with which she have throw her clothes aside
with its grace and carelessness it seem to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of thought as though big brother and the party and the thought police can all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm
that too be a gesture belong to the ancient time
Winston wake up with the word shakespeare on his lip
the telescreen be give forth a ear-splitting whistle which continue on the same note for thirty second
it be nought seven fifteen getting-up time for office worker
Winston wrench his body out of bed naked for a member of the outer party receive only 3,000 clothing coupon annually and a suit of pyjamas be 600 and seize a dingy singlet and a pair of short that be lie across a chair
the physical jerk will begin in three minute
the next moment he be double up by a violent cough fit which nearly always attack him soon after wake up
it empty his lung so completely that he can only begin breathe again by lie on his back and take a series of deep gasp
his vein have swell with the effort of the cough and the varicose ulcer have start itch
thirty to forty group yap a piercing female voice
thirty to forty group
take your place please
thirty to fourty
Winston spring to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dress in tunic and gym-shoes have already appear
arm bend and stretch she rap out
take your time by me
one two three four
one two three four
come on comrade put a bit of life into it
one two three four
one two three four
the pain of the cough fit have not quite drive out of Winston have mind the impression make by his dream and the rhythmic movement of the exercise restore it somewhat
as he mechanically shoot his arm back and forth wear on his face the look of grim enjoyment which be consider proper during the physical jerk he be struggle to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood
it be extraordinarily difficult
beyond the late fifty everything fade
when there be no external record that you can refer to even the outline of your own life lose its sharpness
you remember huge event which have quite probably not happen you remember the detail of incident without be able to recapture their atmosphere and there be long blank period to which you can assign nothing
everything have be different then
even the name of country and their shape on the map have be different
Airstrip one for instance have not be so call in those day it have be call England or Britain though London he feel fairly certain have always be call London
Winston can not definitely remember a time when his country have not be at war but it be evident that there have be a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memory be of a air raid which appear to take everyone by surprise
perhaps it be the time when the atomic bomb have fall on Colchester
he do not remember the raid itself but he do remember his father have hand clutch his own as they hurry down down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase which ring under his foot and which finally so weary his leg that he begin whimper and they have to stop and rest
his mother in her slow dreamy way be follow a long way behind them
she be carry his baby sister or perhaps it be only a bundle of blanket that she be carry he be not certain whether his sister have be born then
finally they have emerge into a noisy crowded place which he have realize to be a tube station
there be people sit all over the stone-flagged floor and other people pack tightly together be sit on metal bunk one above the other
Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor and near them a old man and a old woman be sit side by side on a bunk
the old man have on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap push back from very white hair his face be scarlet and his eye be blue and full of tear
he reek of gin
it seem to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat and one can have fancy that the tear well from his eye be pure gin
but though slightly drunk he be also suffer under some grief that be genuine and unbearable
in his childish way Winston grasp that some terrible thing something that be beyond forgiveness and can never be remedy have just happen
it also seem to him that he know what it be
someone whom the old man love a little granddaughter perhaps have be kill
every few minute the old man keep repeat
we do+not ought to 'ave trust them
I say so ma do+not I
that be what come of trust them
I say so all along
we do+not ought to 'ave trust the bugger
but which bugger they do+not ought to have trust Winston can not now remember
since about that time war have be literally continuous though strictly speak it have not always be the same war
for several month during his childhood there have be confused street fighting in London itself some of which he remember vividly
but to trace out the history of the whole period to say who be fight whom at any give moment will have be utterly impossible since no write record and no speak word ever make mention of any other alignment than the existing one
at this moment for example in 1984 if it be 1984 Oceania be at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia
in no public or private utterance be it ever admit that the three power have at any time be group along different line
actually as Winston well know it be only four year since Oceania have be at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia
but that be merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happen to possess because his memory be not satisfactorily under control
officially the change of partner have never happen
Oceania be at war with Eurasia therefore Oceania have always be at war with Eurasia
the enemy of the moment always represent absolute evil and it follow that any past or future agreement with him be impossible
the frightening thing he reflect for the ten thousandth time as he force his shoulder painfully backward with hand on hip they be gyrate their body from the waist a exercise that be supposed to be good for the back muscle the frightening thing be that it must all be true
if the party can thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event it never happen that surely be more terrifying than mere torture and death
the party say that Oceania have never be in alliance with Eurasia
he Winston Smith know that Oceania have be in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four year ago
but where do that knowledge exist
only in his own consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilate
and if all others accept the lie which the party impose if all record tell the same tale then the lie pass into history and become truth
who control the past run the party slogan control the future who control the present control the past
and yet the past though of its nature alterable never have be alter
whatever be true now be true from everlasting to everlasting
it be quite simple
all that be need be a unending series of victory over your own memory
reality control they call it in Newspeak doublethink
stand easy bark the instructress a little more genially
Winston sink his arm to his side and slowly refill his lung with air
his mind slide away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink
to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while tell carefully constructed lie to hold simultaneously two opinion which cancel out know them to be contradictory and believe in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while lay claim to it to believe that democracy be impossible and that the party be the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it be necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it be need and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
that be the ultimate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you have just perform
even to understand the word doublethink involve the use of doublethink
the instructress have call them to attention again
and now let 's see which of us can touch our toe she say enthusiastically
right over from the hip please comrade
one-two
one-two
Winston loathe this exercise which sent shoot pain all the way from his heel to his buttock and often end by bring on another cough fit
the half-pleasant quality go out of his meditation
the past he reflect have not merely be alter it have be actually destroy
for how can you establish even the most obvious fact when there exist no record outside your own memory
he try to remember in what year he have first hear mention of big brother
he think it must have be at some time in the sixties but it be impossible to be certain
in the party history of course big brother figure as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very early day
his exploit have be gradually push backwards in time until already they extend into the fabulous world of the fourty and the thirty when the capitalist in their strange cylindrical hat still ride through the street of London in great gleaming motor-car or horse carriage with glass side
there be no know how much of this legend be true and how much invent
Winston can not even remember at what date the party itself have come into existence
he do not believe he have ever hear the word Ingsoc before 1960 but it be possible that in its oldspeak form English socialism that be to say it have be current early
everything melt into mist
sometimes indeed you can put your finger on a definite lie
it be not true for example as be claim in the party history book that the party have invent aeroplane
he remember aeroplane since his early childhood
but you can prove nothing
there be never any evidence
just once in his whole life he have hold in his hand unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of a historical fact
and on that occasion
Smith scream the shrewish voice from the telescreen 6079 Smith Winston
yes you
bend lower please
you can do better than that
you be not try
lower please
that be good comrade
now stand at ease the whole squad and watch me
a sudden hot sweat have broken out all over Winston have body
his face remain completely inscrutable
never show dismay
never show resentment
a single flicker of the eye can give you away
he stand watch while the instructress raise her arm above her head and one can not say gracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiency bend over and tuck the first joint of her finger under her toe
there comrade
that be how I want to see you do it
watch me again
I be thirty-nine and I have have four child
now look
she bend over again
you see my knee be+not bend
you can all do it if you want to she add as she straighten herself up
anyone under forty-five be perfectly capable of touch his toe
we do+not all have the privilege of fight in the front line but at least we can all keep fit
remember our boy on the malabar front
and the sailor in the floating fortress
just think what they have to put up with
now try again
that be good comrade that be much good she add encouragingly as Winston with a violent lunge succeed in touch his toe with knee unbent for the first time in several year
with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen can prevent him from utter when his day have work start Winston pull the speakwrite towards him blow the dust from its mouthpiece and put on his spectacle
then he unroll and clip together four small cylinder of paper which have already flop out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk
in the wall of the cubicle there be three orifice
to the right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for write message to the left a large one for newspaper and in the side wall within easy reach of Winston have arm a large oblong slit protect by a wire grating
this last be for the disposal of waste paper
similar slit exist in thousand or ten of thousand throughout the building not only in every room but at short interval in every corridor
for some reason they be nickname memory hole
when one know that any document be due for destruction or even when one see a scrap of waste paper lie about it be a automatic action to lift the flap of the near memory hole and drop it in whereupon it will be whirl away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnace which be hide somewhere in the recess of the building
Winston examine the four slip of paper which he have unroll
each contain a message of only one or two line in the abbreviated jargon not actually Newspeak but consist largely of Newspeak word which be use in the ministry for internal purpose
they run
time 17.3.84 bb speech malreport africa rectify
time 19.12.83 forecast 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprint verify current issue
time 14.2.84 miniplenty malquote chocolate rectify
time 3.12.83 report bb dayorder dubleplusungood refs unperson rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
with a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston lay the fourth message aside
it be a intricate and responsible job and have better be deal with last
the other three be routine matter though the second one will probably mean some tedious wade through list of figure
Winston dial back number on the telescreen and call for the appropriate issue of the Times which slide out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minute have delay
the message he have receive refer to article or news item which for one reason or another it be think necessary to alter or as the official phrase have it to rectify
for example it appear from the Times of the seventeenth of March that big brother in his speech of the previous day have predict that the south Indian front will remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive will shortly be launch in north Africa
as it happen the Eurasian high command have launch its offensive in south India and leave north Africa alone
it be therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother have speech in such a way as to make him predict the thing that have actually happen
or again the Times of the nineteenth of December have publish the official forecast of the output of various class of consumption good in the fourth quarter of 1983 which be also the sixth quarter of the ninth Three-Year plan
today have issue contain a statement of the actual output from which it appear that the forecast be in every instance grossly wrong
Winston have job be to rectify the original figure by make them agree with the late one
as for the third message it refer to a very simple error which can be set right in a couple of minute
as short a time ago as February the ministry of plenty have issue a promise a categorical pledge be the official word that there will be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984
actually as Winston be aware the chocolate ration be to be reduce from thirty gramme to twenty at the end of the present week
all that be need be to substitute for the original promise a warning that it will probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April
as soon as Winston have deal with each of the message he clip his speakwritten correction to the appropriate copy of the Times and push them into the pneumatic tube
then with a movement which be as nearly as possible unconscious he crumple up the original message and any note that he himself have make and drop them into the memory hole to be devour by the flame
what happen in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tube lead he do not know in detail but he do know in general term
as soon as all the correction which happen to be necessary in any particular number of the Times have be assemble and collate that number will be reprint the original copy destroy and the corrected copy place on the file in its stead
this process of continuous alteration be apply not only to newspaper but to book periodical pamphlet poster leaflet film sound-track cartoon photograph to every kind of literature or documentation which must conceivably hold any political or ideological significance
day by day and almost minute by minute the past be bring up to date
in this way every prediction make by the party can be show by documentary evidence to have be correct nor be any item of news or any expression of opinion which conflict with the need of the moment ever allow to remain on record
all history be a palimpsest scrape clean and reinscribe exactly as often as be necessary
in no case will it have be possible once the deed be do to prove that any falsification have take place
the large section of the record department far large than the one on which Winston work consist simply of person whose duty it be to track down and collect all copy of book newspaper and other document which have be supersede and be due for destruction
a number of the Times which must because of change in political alignment or mistaken prophecy utter by big brother have be rewrite a dozen time still stand on the file bear its original date and no other copy exist to contradict it
book also be recall and rewrite again and again and be invariably reissue without any admission that any alteration have be make
even the write instruction which Winston receive and which he invariably get rid of as soon as he have deal with them never state or imply that a act of forgery be to be commit always the reference be to slip error misprint or misquotation which it be necessary to put right in the interest of accuracy
but actually he think as he re-adjusted the ministry of plenty have figure it be not even forgery
it be merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another
most of the material that you be deal with have no connexion with anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that be contain in a direct lie
statistic be just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectify version
a great deal of the time you be expect to make them up out of your head
for example the ministry of plenty have forecast have estimate the output of boot for the quarter at 145 million pair
the actual output be give as sixty-two million
Winston however in rewrite the forecast mark the figure down to fifty-seven million so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota have be overfulfilled
in any case sixty-two million be no nearer the truth than fiftyseven million or than 145 million
Very likely no boot have be produce at all
likely still nobody know how many have be produce much less care
all one know be that every quarter astronomical number of boot be produce on paper while perhaps half the population of Oceania go barefoot
and so it be with every class of record fact great or small
everything fade away into a shadow-world in which finally even the date of the year have become uncertain
Winston glance across the hall
in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small precise-looking dark-chinned man name tillotson be work steadily away with a fold newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite
he have the air of try to keep what he be say a secret between himself and the telescreen
he look up and his spectacle dart a hostile flash in Winston have direction
Winston hardly know tillotson and have no idea what work he be employ on
people in the record department do not readily talk about their job
in the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicle and its endless rustle of paper and hum of voice murmur into speakwrite there be quite a dozen people whom Winston do not even know by name though he daily see them hurry to and fro in the corridor or gesticulate in the two minute hate
he know that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toil day in day out simply at track down and delete from the press the name of people who have be vaporize and be therefore consider never to have exist
there be a certain fitness in this since her own husband have be vaporize a couple of year early
and a few cubicle away a mild ineffectual dreamy creature name ampleforth with very hairy ear and a surprising talent for juggle with rhyme and metre be engage in produce garbled version definitive text they be call of poem which have become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another be to be retain in the anthology
and this hall with its fifty worker or thereabouts be only one sub-section a single cell as it be in the huge complexity of the record department
beyond above below be other swarm of worker engage in a unimaginable multitude of job
there be the huge printingshop with their sub-editors their typography expert and their elaborately equip studio for the fake of photograph
there be the tele-programmes section with its engineer its producer and its team of actor specially choose for their skill in imitate voice
there be the army of reference clerk whose job be simply to draw up list of book and periodical which be due for recall
there be the vast repository where the correct document be store and the hide furnace where the original copy be destroy
and somewhere or other quite anonymous there be the direct brain who co-ordinate the whole effort and lay down the line of policy which make it necessary that this fragment of the past shall be preserve that one falsify and the other rub out of existence
and the record department after all be itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth whose primary job be not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizen of Oceania with newspaper film textbook telescreen programme play novel with every conceivable kind of information instruction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a child have spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary
and the ministry have not only to supply the multifarious need of the party but also to repeat the whole operation at a low level for the benefit of the proletariat
there be a whole chain of separate department deal with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally
here be produce rubbishy newspaper contain almost nothing except sport crime and astrology sensational five-cent novelette film ooze with sex and sentimental song which be compose entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope know as a versificator
there be even a whole sub-section pornosec it be call in Newspeak engage in produce the low kind of pornography which be sent out in sealed packet and which no party member other than those who work on it be permit to look at
three message have slide out of the pneumatic tube while Winston be work but they be simple matter and he have dispose of them before the two minute hate interrupt him
when the hate be over he return to his cubicle take the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf push the speakwrite to one side clean his spectacle and settle down to his main job of the morning
Winston have great pleasure in life be in his work
most of it be a tedious routine but include in it there be also job so difficult and intricate that you can lose yourself in them as in the depth of a mathematical problem delicate piece of forgery in which you have nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principle of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the party want you to say
Winston be good at this kind of thing
on occasion he have even be entrust with the rectification of the Times leading article which be write entirely in Newspeak
he unroll the message that he have set aside early
it run
times 3.12.83 report bb dayorder doubleplusungood ref unperson rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
in oldspeak or standard English this must be render
the report of big brother have order for the day in the Times of December 3rd 1983 be extremely unsatisfactory and make reference to non-existent person
rewrite it in full and submit your draft to high authority before file
Winston read through the offend article
big brother have order for the day it seem have be chiefly devote to praise the work of a organization know as FFCC which supply cigarette and other comfort to the sailor in the floating fortress
a certain comrade Withers a prominent member of the inner party have be single out for special mention and award a decoration the order of conspicuous merit second class
three month later FFCC have suddenly be dissolve with no reason give
one can assume that Withers and his associate be now in disgrace but there have be no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen
that be to be expect since it be unusual for political offender to be put on trial or even publicly denounce
the great purge involve thousand of people with public trial of traitor and thought-criminal who make abject confession of their crime and be afterwards execute be special show-pieces not occur often than once in a couple of year
more commonly people who have incur the displeasure of the party simply disappear and be never hear of again
one never have the small clue as to what have happen to them
in some case they must not even be dead
perhaps thirty people personally know to Winston not count his parent have disappear at one time or another
Winston stroke his nose gently with a paper-clip
in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson be still crouch secretively over his speakwrite
he raise his head for a moment again the hostile spectacle-flash
Winston wonder whether comrade tillotson be engage on the same job as himself
it be perfectly possible
so tricky a piece of work will never be entrust to a single person on the other hand to turn it over to a committee will be to admit openly that a act of fabrication be take place
Very likely as many as a dozen people be now work away on rival version of what big brother have actually say
and presently some master brain in the inner party will select this version or that will re-edit it and set in motion the complex process of cross-reference that will be require and then the choose lie will pass into the permanent record and become truth
Winston do not know why Withers have be disgrace
perhaps it be for corruption or incompetence
perhaps big brother be merely get rid of a too-popular subordinate
perhaps Withers or someone close to him have be suspect of heretical tendency
or perhaps what be likely of all the thing have simply happen because purge and vaporization be a necessary part of the mechanics of government
the only real clue lie in the word ref unperson which indicate that Withers be already dead
you can not invariably assume this to be the case when people be arrest
sometimes they be release and allow to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two year before be execute
Very occasionally some person whom you have believe dead long since will make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he will implicate hundred of others by his testimony before vanish this time for ever
Withers however be already a unperson
he do not exist he have never exist
Winston decide that it will not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother have speech
it be good to make it deal with something totally unconnect with its original subject
he must turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitor and thought-criminal but that be a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumph of over-production in the ninth Three-Year plan must complicate the record too much
what be need be a piece of pure fantasy
suddenly there spring into his mind ready make as it be the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who have recently die in battle in heroic circumstance
there be occasion when big brother devote his order for the day to commemorate some humble rank-and-file party member whose life and death he hold up as a example worthy to be follow
today he shall commemorate comrade ogilvy
it be true that there be no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few line of print and a couple of fake photograph will soon bring him into existence
Winston think for a moment then pull the speakwrite towards him and begin dictate in big brother have familiar style a style at once military and pedantic and because of a trick of ask question and then promptly answer them what lesson do we learn from this fact comrade
the lesson which be also one of the fundamental principle of Ingsoc that etc. etc. easy to imitate
at the age of three comrade ogilvy have refuse all toy except a drum a sub-machine gun and a model helicopter
at six a year early by a special relaxation of the rule he have join the spy at nine he have be a troop leader
at eleven he have denounce his uncle to the thought police after overhear a conversation which appear to him to have criminal tendency
at seventeen he have be a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex league
at nine teen he have design a hand-grenade which have be adopt by the ministry of peace and which at its first trial have kill thirtyone Eurasian prisoner in one burst
at twenty-three he have perish in action
pursue by enemy jet plane while fly over the Indian ocean with important despatch he have weighted his body with his machine gun and leap out of the helicopter into deep water despatch and all a end say big brother which it be impossible to contemplate without feeling of envy
big brother add a few remark on the purity and single-mindedness of comrade ogilvy have life
he be a total abstainer and a nonsmoker have no recreation except a daily hour in the gymnasium and have take a vow of celibacy believe marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty
he have no subject of conversation except the principle of Ingsoc and no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spy saboteur thoughtcriminals and traitor generally
Winston debate with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit in the end he decide against it because of the unnecessary cross-reference that it will entail
once again he glance at his rival in the opposite cubicle
something seem to tell him with certainty that tillotson be busy on the same job as himself
there be no way of know whose job will finally be adopt but he feel a profound conviction that it will be his own
comrade ogilvy unimagined a hour ago be now a fact
it strike him as curious that you can create dead man but not living one
comrade ogilvy who have never exist in the present now exist in the past and when once the act of forgery be forget he will exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as charlemagne or julius caesar
in the low-ceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerk slowly forward
the room be already very full and deafeningly noisy
from the grille at the counter the steam of stew come pour forth with a sour metallic smell which do not quite overcome the fume of victory gin
on the far side of the room there be a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin can be buy at ten cent the large nip
just the man I be look for say a voice at Winston have back
he turn round
it be his friend Syme who work in the research department
perhaps friend be not exactly the right word
you do not have friend nowadays you have comrade but there be some comrade whose society be pleasanter than that of others
Syme be a philologist a specialist in Newspeak
indeed he be one of the enormous team of expert now engage in compile the eleventh edition of the Newspeak dictionary
he be a tiny creature small than Winston with dark hair and large protuberant eye at once mournful and derisive which seem to search your face closely while he be speak to you
I want to ask you whether you have get any razor blade he say
not one say Winston with a sort of guilty haste
I have try all over the place
they do+not exist any longer
everyone keep ask you for razor blade
actually he have two unused one which he be hoard up
there have be a famine of them for month past
at any give moment there be some necessary article which the party shop be unable to supply
sometimes it be button sometimes it be darn wool sometimes it be shoelace at present it be razor blade
you can only get hold of them if at all by scrounge more or less furtively on the free market
I have be use the same blade for six week he add untruthfully
the queue give another jerk forward
as they halt he turn and face Syme again
each of them take a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter
do you go and see the prisoner hang yesterday
say Syme
I be work say Winston indifferently
I shall see it on the flick I suppose
a very inadequate substitute say Syme
his mocking eye rove over Winston have face
I know you the eye seem to say I see through you
I know very well why you do+not go to see those prisoner hang
in a intellectual way Syme be venomously orthodox
he will talk with a disagreeable gloat satisfaction of helicopter raid on enemy village and trial and confession of thought-criminal the execution in the cellar of the ministry of love
talk to him be largely a matter of get him away from such subject and entangle him if possible in the technicality of Newspeak on which he be authoritative and interesting
Winston turn his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eye
it be a good hanging say Syme reminiscent
I think it spoil it when they tie their foot together
I like to see them kick
and above all at the end the tongue stick right out and blue a quite bright blue
that be the detail that appeal to me
nex' please yell the white-aproned prole with the ladle
Winston and Syme push their tray beneath the grille
on to each be dump swiftly the regulation lunch a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee and one saccharine tablet
there be a table over there under that telescreen say Syme
let 's pick up a gin on the way
the gin be serve out to them in handleless china mug
they thread their way across the crowded room and unpack their tray on to the metal-topped table on one corner of which someone have leave a pool of stew a filthy liquid mess that have the appearance of vomit
Winston take up his mug of gin pause for a instant to collect his nerve and gulp the oily-tasting stuff down
when he have wink the tear out of his eye he suddenly discover that he be hungry
he begin swallow spoonful of the stew which in among its general sloppiness have cube of spongy pinkish stuff which be probably a preparation of meat
neither of them speak again till they have empty their pannikin
from the table at Winston have left a little behind his back someone be talk rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quack of a duck which pierce the general uproar of the room
how be the dictionary get on
say Winston raise his voice to overcome the noise
slowly say Syme
I be on the adjective
it be fascinating
he have brighten up immediately at the mention of Newspeak
he push his pannikin aside take up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other and lean across the table so as to be able to speak without shout
the eleventh edition be the definitive edition he say
we be get the language into its final shape the shape it be go to have when nobody speak anything else
when we have finish with it people like you will have to learn it all over again
you think I dare say that our chief job be invent new word
but not a bit of it
we be destroy word score of them hundred of them every day
we be cut the language down to the bone
the eleventh edition will+not contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050
he bite hungrily into his bread and swallow a couple of mouthful then continue speak with a sort of pedant have passion
his thin dark face have become animated his eye have lose their mocking expression and grow almost dreamy
it be a beautiful thing the destruction of word
of course the great wastage be in the verb and adjective but there be hundred of noun that can be get rid of as well
it be+not only the synonym there be also the antonym
after all what justification be there for a word which be simply the opposite of some other word
a word contain its opposite in itself
take good for instance
if you have a word like good what need be there for a word like bad
ungood will do just as well better because it be a exact opposite which the other be not
or again if you want a strong version of good what sense be there in have a whole string of vague useless word like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them
plusgood cover the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something strong still
of course we use those form already but in the final version of Newspeak there will be nothing else
in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be cover by only six word in reality only one word
do+not you see the beauty of that Winston
it be Big_Brother have idea originally of course he add as a afterthought
a sort of vapid eagerness flit across Winston have face at the mention of big brother
nevertheless Syme immediately detect a certain lack of enthusiasm
you have+not a real appreciation of Newspeak Winston he say almost sadly
even when you write it you be still think in oldspeak
I have read some of those piece that you write in the Times occasionally
they be good enough but they be translation
in your heart you will prefer to stick to oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shade of meaning
you do+not grasp the beauty of the destruction of word
do you know that Newspeak be the only language in the world whose vocabulary get small every year
Winston do know that of course
he smile sympathetically he hope not trust himself to speak
Syme bite off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread chew it briefly and go on
do+not you see that the whole aim of Newspeak be to narrow the range of thought
in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no word in which to express it
every concept that can ever be need will be express by exactly one word with its meaning rigidly define and all its subsidiary meaning rub out and forget
already in the eleventh edition we be not far from that point
but the process will still be continue long after you and I be dead
every year few and few word and the range of consciousness always a little small
even now of course there be no reason or excuse for commit thoughtcrime
it be merely a question of self-discipline reality-control
but in the end there will+not be any need even for that
the revolution will be complete when the language be perfect
Newspeak be Ingsoc and Ingsoc be Newspeak he add with a sort of mystical satisfaction
have it ever occur to you Winston that by the year 2050 at the very late not a single human being will be alive who can understand such a conversation as we be have now
except begin Winston doubtfully and he stop
it have be on the tip of his tongue to say except the prole but he check himself not feel fully certain that this remark be not in some way unorthodox
Syme however have divine what he be about to say
the prole be not human being he say carelessly
by 2050 early probably all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappear
the whole literature of the past will have be destroy
chaucer shakespeare milton byron they will exist only in Newspeak version not merely change into something different but actually change into something contradictory of what they use to be
even the literature of the party will change
even the slogan will change
how can you have a slogan like freedom be slavery when the concept of freedom have be abolish
the whole climate of thought will be different
in fact there will be no thought as we understand it now
orthodoxy mean not think not need to think
orthodoxy be unconsciousness
one of these day think Winston with sudden deep conviction Syme will be vaporize
he be too intelligent
he see too clearly and speak too plainly
the party do not like such people
one day he will disappear
it be write in his face
Winston have finish his bread and cheese
he turn a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee
at the table on his left the man with the strident voice be still talk remorselessly away
a young woman who be perhaps his secretary and who be sit with her back to Winston be listen to him and seem to be eagerly agree with everything that he say
from time to time Winston catch some such remark as I think you be so right I do so agree with you utter in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice
but the other voice never stop for a instant even when the girl be speak
Winston know the man by sight though he know no more about him than that he hold some important post in the fiction department
he be a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth
his head be throw back a little and because of the angle at which he be sit his spectacle catch the light and present to Winston two blank disc instead of eye
what be slightly horrible be that from the stream of sound that pour out of his mouth it be almost impossible to distinguish a single word
just once Winston catch a phrase complete and final elimination of goldsteinism jerk out very rapidly and as it seem all in one piece like a line of type cast solid
for the rest it be just a noise a quackquack-quacking
and yet though you can not actually hear what the man be say you can not be in any doubt about its general nature
he must be denounce Goldstein and demand stern measure against thought-criminal and saboteur he must be fulminate against the atrocity of the Eurasian army he must be praise big brother or the hero on the malabar front it make no difference
whatever it be you can be certain that every word of it be pure orthodoxy pure Ingsoc
as he watch the eyeless face with the jaw move rapidly up and down Winston have a curious feeling that this be not a real human being but some kind of dummy
it be not the man have brain that be speak it be his larynx
the stuff that be come out of him consist of word but it be not speech in the true sense it be a noise utter in unconsciousness like the quack of a duck
Syme have fall silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon be trace pattern in the puddle of stew
the voice from the other table quack rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding din
there be a word in Newspeak say Syme I do+not know whether you know it duckspeak to quack like a duck
it be one of those interesting word that have two contradictory meaning
apply to a opponent it be abuse apply to someone you agree with it be praise
unquestionably Syme will be vaporize Winston think again
he think it with a kind of sadness although well know that Syme despise him and slightly dislike him and be fully capable of denounce him as a thought-criminal if he see any reason for do so
there be something subtly wrong with Syme
there be something that he lack discretion aloofness a sort of saving stupidity
you can not say that he be unorthodox
he believe in the principle of Ingsoc he venerate big brother he rejoice over victory he hate heretic not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal a up-to-dateness of information which the ordinary party member do not approach
yet a faint air of disreputability always cling to him
he say thing that will have be better unsaid he have read too many book he frequent the chestnut tree cafe haunt of painter and musician
there be no law not even a unwritten law against frequent the chestnut tree cafe yet the place be somehow ill-omened
the old discredit leader of the party have be use to gather there before they be finally purge
Goldstein himself it be say have sometimes be see there year and decade ago
Syme have fate be not difficult to foresee
and yet it be a fact that if Syme grasp even for three second the nature of his Winston have secret opinion he will betray him instantly to the thought police
so will anybody else for that matter but Syme more than most
zeal be not enough
orthodoxy be unconsciousness
Syme look up
here come Parsons he say
something in the tone of his voice seem to add that bloody fool
Parsons Winston have fellow-tenant at victory mansion be in fact thread his way across the room a tubby middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face
at thirty-five he be already put on roll of fat at neck and waistline but his movement be brisk and boyish
his whole appearance be that of a little boy grow large so much so that although he be wear the regulation overall it be almost impossible not to think of him as be dress in the blue short grey shirt and red neckerchief of the spy
in visualize him one see always a picture of dimple knee and sleeve roll back from pudgy forearm
Parsons do indeed invariably revert to short when a community hike or any other physical activity give him a excuse for do so
he greet them both with a cheery hullo hullo and sit down at the table give off a intense smell of sweat
bead of moisture stand out all over his pink face
his power of sweat be extraordinary
at the community centre you can always tell when he have be play table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle
Syme have produce a strip of paper on which there be a long column of word and be study it with a ink-pencil between his finger
look at him work away in the lunch hour say Parsons nudge Winston
keenness eh
what be that you have get there old boy
something a bit too brainy for me I expect
Smith old boy I will tell you why I be chase you
it be that sub you forget to give me
which sub be that
say Winston automatically feel for money
about a quarter of one have salary have to be earmark for voluntary subscription which be so numerous that it be difficult to keep track of them
for hate week
you know the house-by-house fund
I be treasurer for our block
we be make a all-out effort go to put on a tremendous show
I tell you it will+not be my fault if old victory mansion do+not have the big outfit of flag in the whole street
two dollar you promise me
Winston find and hand over two crease and filthy note which Parsons enter in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate
by the way old boy he say I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday
I give him a good dressing down for it
in fact I tell him I will take the catapult away if he do it again
I think he be a little upset at not go to the execution say Winston
ah well what I mean to say show the right spirit do+not it
mischievous little beggar they be both of them but talk about keenness
all they think about be the spy and the war of course
will you know what that little girl of mine do last Saturday when her troop be on a hike out berkhamsted way
she get two other girl to go with her slip off from the hike and spend the whole afternoon follow a strange man
they keep on his tail for two hour right through the wood and then when they get into amersham hand him over to the patrol
what do they do that for
say Winston somewhat take aback
Parsons go on triumphantly
my kid make sure he be some kind of enemy agent must have be drop by parachute for instance
but here be the point old boy
what do you think put her on to him in the first place
she spot he be wear a funny kind of shoe say she have never see anyone wear shoe like that before
so the chance be he be a foreigner
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh
what happen to the man
say Winston
ah that I could+not say of course
but I would+not be altogether surprise if Parsons make the motion of aim a rifle and click his tongue for the explosion
good say Syme abstractedly without look up from his strip of paper
of course we can+not afford to take chance agree Winston dutiful
what I mean to say there be a war on say Parsons
as though in confirmation of this a trumpet call float from the telescreen just above their head
however it be not the proclamation of a military victory this time but merely a announcement from the ministry of plenty
comrade cry a eager youthful voice
attention comrade
we have glorious news for you
we have win the battle for production
return now complete of the output of all class of consumption good show that the standard of living have rise by no less than 20 per cent over the past year
all over Oceania this morning there be irrepressible spontaneous demonstration when worker march out of factory and office and parade through the street with banner voice their gratitude to big brother for the new happy life which his wise leadership have bestow upon us
here be some of the complete figure
foodstuff
the phrase our new happy life recur several time
it have be a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty
Parsons his attention catch by the trumpet call sit listen with a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edify boredom
he can not follow the figure but he be aware that they be in some way a cause for satisfaction
he have lug out a huge and filthy pipe which be already half full of char tobacco
with the tobacco ration at 100 gramme a week it be seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top
Winston be smoke a victory cigarette which he hold carefully horizontal
the new ration do not start till tomorrow and he have only four cigarette leave
for the moment he have shut his ear to the remote noise and be listen to the stuff that stream out of the telescreen
it appear that there have even be demonstration to thank big brother for raise the chocolate ration to twenty gramme a week
and only yesterday he reflect it have be announce that the ration be to be reduce to twenty gramme a week
be it possible that they can swallow that after only twenty-four hour
yes they swallow it
Parsons swallow it easily with the stupidity of a animal
the eyeless creature at the other table swallow it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who shall suggest that last week the ration have be thirty gramme
Syme too in some more complex way involve doublethink Syme swallow it
be he then alone in the possession of a memory
the fabulous statistics continue to pour out of the telescreen
as compare with last year there be more food more clothes more house more furniture more cooking-pot more fuel more ship more helicopter more book more baby more of everything except disease crime and insanity
year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything be whizz rapidly upwards
as Syme have do early Winston have take up his spoon and be dabble in the pale-coloured gravy that dribble across the table draw a long streak of it out into a pattern
he meditate resentfully on the physical texture of life
have it always be like this
have food always taste like this
he look round the canteen
a low-ceilinged crowded room its wall grimy from the contact of innumerable body battered metal table and chair place so close together that you sit with elbow touch bent spoon dent tray coarse white mug all surface greasy grime in every crack and a sourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes
always in your stomach and in your skin there be a sort of protest a feeling that you have be cheat of something that you have a right to
it be true that he have no memory of anything greatly different
in any time that he can accurately remember there have never be quite enough to eat one have never have sock or underclothes that be not full of hole furniture have always be battered and rickety room underheated tube train crowded house fall to piece bread dark-coloured tea a rarity coffee filthy-tasting cigarette insufficient nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin
and though of course it grow bad as one have body age be it not a sign that this be not the natural order of thing if one have heart sicken at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winter the stickiness of one have sock the lift that never work the cold water the gritty soap the cigarette that come to piece the food with its strange evil taste
why shall one feel it to be intolerable unless one have some kind of ancestral memory that thing have once be different
he look round the canteen again
nearly everyone be ugly and will still have be ugly even if dress otherwise than in the uniform blue overall
on the far side of the room sit at a table alone a small curiously beetle-like man be drink a cup of coffee his little eye dart suspicious glance from side to side
how easy it be think Winston if you do not look about you to believe that the physical type set up by the party as a ideal tall muscular youth and deep-bosomed maiden blond-haired vital sunburnt carefree exist and even predominate
actually so far as he can judge the majority of people in Airstrip one be small dark and ill-favoured
it be curious how that beetle-like type proliferate in the Ministries little dumpy man grow stout very early in life with short leg swift scuttle movement and fat inscrutable face with very small eye
it be the type that seem to flourish best under the dominion of the party
the announcement from the ministry of plenty end on another trumpet call and give way to tinny music
Parsons stir to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figure take his pipe out of his mouth
the ministry of plenty have certainly do a good job this year he say with a knowing shake of his head
by the way Smith old boy I suppose you have+not get any razor blade you can let me have
not one say Winston
I have be use the same blade for six week myself
ah well just think I will ask you old boy
sorry say Winston
the quack voice from the next table temporarily silence during the ministry have announcement have start up again as loud as ever
for some reason Winston suddenly find himself think of mrs Parsons with her wispy hair and the dust in the crease of her face
within two year those child will be denounce her to the thought police
mrs Parsons will be vaporize
Syme will be vaporize
Winston will be vaporize
O'Brien will be vaporize
Parsons on the other hand will never be vaporize
the eyeless creature with the quack voice will never be vaporize
the little beetle-like man who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridor of Ministries they too will never be vaporize
and the girl with dark hair the girl from the fiction department she will never be vaporize either
it seem to him that he know instinctively who will survive and who will perish though just what it be that make for survival it be not easy to say
at this moment he be drag out of his reverie with a violent jerk
the girl at the next table have turn partly round and be look at him
it be the girl with dark hair
she be look at him in a sidelong way but with curious intensity
the instant she catch his eye she look away again
the sweat start out on Winston have backbone
a horrible pang of terror go through him
it be go almost at once but it leave a sort of nagging uneasiness behind
why be she watch him
why do she keep follow him about
unfortunately he can not remember whether she have already be at the table when he arrive or have come there afterwards
but yesterday at any rate during the two minute hate she have sit immediately behind him when there be no apparent need to do so
quite likely her real object have be to listen to him and make sure whether he be shout loudly enough
his early thought return to him probably she be not actually a member of the thought police but then it be precisely the amateur spy who be the great danger of all
he do not know how long she have be look at him but perhaps for as much as five minute and it be possible that his feature have not be perfectly under control
it be terribly dangerous to let your thought wander when you be in any public place or within range of a telescreen
the small thing can give you away
a nervous tic a unconscious look of anxiety a habit of mutter to yourself anything that carry with it the suggestion of abnormality of have something to hide
in any case to wear a improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory be announce for example be itself a punishable offence
there be even a word for it in Newspeak facecrime it be call
the girl have turn her back on him again
perhaps after all she be not really follow him about perhaps it be coincidence that she have sit so close to him two day running
his cigarette have go out and he lay it carefully on the edge of the table
he will finish smoke it after work if he can keep the tobacco in it
quite likely the person at the next table be a spy of the thought police and quite likely he will be in the cellar of the ministry of love within three day but a cigarette end must not be waste
Syme have fold up his strip of paper and stow it away in his pocket
Parsons have begin talk again
do I ever tell you old boy he say chuckle round the stem of his pipe about the time when those two nipper of mine set fire to the old market-woman have skirt because they see her wrap up sausage in a poster of Big_Brother
sneak up behind her and set fire to it with a box of match
burn her quite badly I believe
little beggar eh
but keen as mustard
that be a first-rate train they give them in the spy nowadays good than in my day even
what d' you think be the late thing they have serve them out with
ear trumpet for listen through keyhole
my little girl bring one home the other night try it out on our sitting-room door and reckon she can hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole
of course it be only a toy mind you
still give them the right idea eh
at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle
it be the signal to return to work
all three man spring to their foot to join in the struggle round the lift and the remaining tobacco fall out of Winston have cigarette
Winston be write in his diary
it be three year ago
it be on a dark evening in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway station
she be stand near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly give any light
she have a young face paint very thick
it be really the paint that appeal to me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lip
party woman never paint their face
there be nobody else in the street and no telescreen
she say two dollar
I
for the moment it be too difficult to go on
he shut his eye and press his finger against them try to squeeze out the vision that keep recur
he have a almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy word at the top of his voice
or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that must black out the memory that be torment him
your bad enemy he reflect be your own nervous system
at any moment the tension inside you be liable to translate itself into some visible symptom
he think of a man whom he have pass in the street a few week back a quite ordinary-looking man a party member aged thirty-five to forty tallish and thin carry a brief-case
they be a few metre apart when the left side of the man have face be suddenly contort by a sort of spasm
it happen again just as they be pass one another it be only a twitch a quiver rapid as the click of a camera shutter but obviously habitual
he remember think at the time that poor devil be do for
and what be frightening be that the action be quite possibly unconscious
the most deadly danger of all be talk in your sleep
there be no way of guard against that so far as he can see
he draw his breath and go on write
I go with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen
there be a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turn down very low
she
his tooth be set on edge
he will have like to spit
simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he think of katharine his wife
Winston be married have be married at any rate probably he still be married so far as he know his wife be not dead
he seem to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen a odour compound of bug and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever use scent or can be imagine as do so
only the prole use scent
in his mind the smell of it be inextricably mix up with fornication
when he have go with that woman it have be his first lapse in two year or thereabouts
consort with prostitute be forbidden of course but it be one of those rule that you can occasionally nerve yourself to break
it be dangerous but it be not a life-and-death matter
to be catch with a prostitute must mean five year in a forced-labour camp not more if you have commit no other offence
and it be easy enough provided that you can avoid be catch in the act
the poor quarter swarm with woman who be ready to sell themselves
some can even be purchase for a bottle of gin which the prole be not supposed to drink
tacit the party be even inclined to encourage prostitution as a outlet for instinct which can not be altogether suppress
mere debauchery do not matter very much so long as it be furtive and joyless and only involve the woman of a submerged and despise class
the unforgivable crime be promiscuity between party member
but though this be one of the crime that the accused in the great purge invariably confess to it be difficult to imagine any such thing actually happen
the aim of the party be not merely to prevent man and woman from form loyalty which it must not be able to control
its real undeclared purpose be to remove all pleasure from the sexual act
not love so much as eroticism be the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it
all marriage between party member have to be approve by a committee appoint for the purpose and though the principle be never clearly state permission be always refuse if the couple concern give the impression of be physically attract to one another
the only recognize purpose of marriage be to beget child for the service of the party
sexual intercourse be to be look on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like have a enema
this again be never put into plain word but in a indirect way it be rub into every party member from childhood onwards
there be even organization such as the Junior Anti-Sex league which advocate complete celibacy for both sex
all child be to be beget by artificial insemination artsem it be call in Newspeak and bring up in public institution
this Winston be aware be not mean altogether seriously but somehow it fit in with the general ideology of the party
the party be try to kill the sex instinct or if it can not be kill then to distort it and dirty it
he do not know why this be so but it seem natural that it shall be so
and as far as the woman be concern the party have effort be largely successful
he think again of katharine
it must be nine ten nearly eleven year since they have part
it be curious how seldom he think of her
for day at a time he be capable of forget that he have ever be married
they have only be together for about fifteen month
the party do not permit divorce but it rather encourage separation in case where there be no child
katharine be a tall fair-haired girl very straight with splendid movement
she have a bold aquiline face a face that one must have call noble until one discover that there be as nearly as possible nothing behind it
Very early in her married life he have decide though perhaps it be only that he know her more intimately than he know most people that she have without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he have ever encounter
she have not a thought in her head that be not a slogan and there be no imbecility absolutely none that she be not capable of swallow if the party hand it out to her
the human sound-track he nickname her in his own mind
yet he can have endure live with her if it have not be for just one thing sex
as soon as he touch her she seem to wince and stiffen
to embrace her be like embrace a jointed wooden image
and what be strange be that even when she be clasp him against her he have the feeling that she be simultaneously push him away with all her strength
the rigidity of her muscle manage to convey that impression
she will lie there with shut eye neither resist nor co-operate but submit
it be extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible
but even then he can have bear live with her if it have be agree that they shall remain celibate
but curiously enough it be katharine who refuse this
they must she say produce a child if they can
so the performance continue to happen once a week quite regularity whenever it be not impossible
she even use to remind him of it in the morning as something which have to be do that evening and which must not be forget
she have two name for it
one be make a baby and the other be our duty to the party yes she have actually use that phrase
quite soon he grow to have a feeling of positive dread when the appoint day come round
but luckily no child appear and in the end she agree to give up try and soon afterwards they part
Winston sigh inaudibly
he pick up his pen again and write
she throw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pull up her skirt
I
he see himself stand there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bug and cheap scent in his nostril and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment be mixed up with the thought of katharine have white body freeze for ever by the hypnotic power of the party
why do it always have to be like this
why can he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffle at interval of year
but a real love affair be a almost unthinkable event
the woman of the party be all alike
chastity be as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty
by careful early conditioning by game and cold water by the rubbish that be din into them at school and in the spy and the youth league by lecture parade song slogan and martial music the natural feeling have be drive out of them
his reason tell him that there must be exception but his heart do not believe it
they be all impregnable as the party intend that they shall be
and what he want more even than to be love be to break down that wall of virtue even if it be only once in his whole life
the sexual act successfully perform be rebellion
desire be thoughtcrime
even to have awaken katharine if he can have achieve it will have be like a seduction although she be his wife
but the rest of the story have get to be write down
he write
I turn up the lamp
when I see her in the light
after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp have seem very bright
for the first time he can see the woman properly
he have take a step towards her and then halt full of lust and terror
he be painfully conscious of the risk he have take in come here
it be perfectly possible that the patrol will catch him on the way out for that matter they must be wait outside the door at this moment
if he go away without even do what he have come here to do
it have get to be write down it have get to be confess
what he have suddenly see in the lamplight be that the woman be old
the paint be plaster so thick on her face that it look as though it must crack like a cardboard mask
there be streak of white in her hair but the truly dreadful detail be that her mouth have fall a little open reveal nothing except a cavernous blackness
she have no tooth at all
he write hurriedly in scrabble handwriting
when I see her in the light she be quite a old woman fifty year old at least
but I go ahead and do it just the same
he press his finger against his eyelid again
he have write it down at last but it make no difference
the therapy have not work
the urge to shout filthy word at the top of his voice be as strong as ever
if there be hope write Winston it lie in the prole
if there be hope it must lie in the prole because only there in those swarm disregard mass 85 per cent of the population of Oceania can the force to destroy the party ever be generate
the party can not be overthrow from within
its enemy if it have any enemy have no way of come together or even of identify one another
even if the legendary brotherhood exist as just possibly it must it be inconceivable that its member can ever assemble in large number than two and three
rebellion mean a look in the eye a inflexion of the voice at the most a occasional whispered word
but the prole if only they can somehow become conscious of their own strength will have no need to conspire
they need only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shake off fly
if they choose they can blow the party to piece tomorrow morning
surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it
and yet
he remember how once he have be walk down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundred of voice woman have voice have burst from a side-street a little way ahead
it be a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud oh-o-o-o-oh that go hum on like the reverberation of a bell
his heart have leap
it have start he have think
a riot
the prole be break loose at last
when he have reach the spot it be to see a mob of two or three hundred woman crowd round the stall of a street market with face as tragic as though they have be the doomed passenger on a sink ship
but at this moment the general despair break down into a multitude of individual quarrel
it appear that one of the stall have be sell tin saucepan
they be wretched flimsy thing but cooking-pot of any kind be always difficult to get
now the supply have unexpectedly give out
the successful woman bump and jostle by the rest be try to make off with their saucepan while dozen of others clamour round the stall accuse the stallkeeper of favouritism and of have more saucepan somewhere in reserve
there be a fresh outburst of yell
two bloated woman one of them with her hair come down have get hold of the same saucepan and be try to tear it out of one another have hand
for a moment they be both tug and then the handle come off
Winston watch them disgusted
and yet just for a moment what almost frightening power have sound in that cry from only a few hundred throat
why be it that they can never shout like that about anything that matter
he write
until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebel they cannot become conscious
that he reflect must almost have be a transcription from one of the party textbook
the party claim of course to have liberate the prole from bondage
before the revolution they have be hideously oppress by the capitalist they have be starve and flog woman have be force to work in the coal mine woman still do work in the coal mine as a matter of fact child have be sold into the factory at the age of six
but simultaneously true to the principle of doublethink the party teach that the prole be natural inferior who must be keep in subjection like animal by the application of a few simple rule
in reality very little be know about the prole
it be not necessary to know much
so long as they continue to work and breed their other activity be without importance
leave to themselves like cattle turn loose upon the plain of Argentina they have revert to a style of life that appear to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern
they be born they grow up in the gutter they go to work at twelve they pass through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire they marry at twenty they be middle-aged at thirty they die for the most part at sixty
heavy physical work the care of home and child petty quarrel with neighbour film football beer and above all gambling fill up the horizon of their mind
to keep them in control be not difficult
a few agent of the thought police move always among them spread false rumour and mark down and eliminate the few individual who be judge capable of become dangerous but no attempt be make to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party
it be not desirable that the prole shall have strong political feeling
all that be require of them be a primitive patriotism which can be appeal to whenever it be necessary to make them accept long working-hours or short ration
and even when they become discontented as they sometimes do their discontent lead nowhere because be without general idea they can only focus it on petty specific grievance
the large evil invariably escape their notice
the great majority of prole do not even have telescreen in their home
even the civil police interfere with them very little
there be a vast amount of criminality in London a whole world-within-a-world of thief bandit prostitute drug-peddlers and racketeer of every description but since it all happen among the prole themselves it be of no importance
in all question of morals they be allow to follow their ancestral code
the sexual puritanism of the party be not impose upon them
promiscuity go unpunished divorce be permit
for that matter even religious worship will have be permit if the prole have show any sign of need or want it
they be beneath suspicion
as the party slogan put it prole and animal be free
Winston reach down and cautiously scratch his varicose ulcer
it have begin itch again
the thing you invariably come back to be the impossibility of know what life before the revolution have really be like
he take out of the drawer a copy of a child have history textbook which he have borrow from mrs Parsons and begin copy a passage into the diary
in the old day it run before the glorious revolution London be not the beautiful city that we know today
it be a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody have enough to eat and where hundred and thousand of poor people have no boot on their foot and not even a roof to sleep under
child no old than you have to work twelve hour a day for cruel master who flog them with whip if they work too slowly and feed them on nothing but stale breadcrust and water
but in among all this terrible poverty there be just a few great big beautiful house that be live in by rich man who have as many as thirty servant to look after them
these rich man be call capitalist
they be fat ugly man with wicked face like the one in the picture on the opposite page
you can see that he be dress in a long black coat which be call a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shape like a stovepipe which be call a top hat
this be the uniform of the capitalist and no one else be allow to wear it
the capitalist own everything in the world and everyone else be their slave
they own all the land all the house all the factory and all the money
if anyone disobey them they can throw them into prison or they can take his job away and starve him to death
when any ordinary person speak to a capitalist he have to cringe and bow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir
the chief of all the capitalist be call the king and
but he know the rest of the catalogue
there will be mention of the bishop in their lawn sleeve the judge in their ermine robe the pillory the stock the treadmill the cat-o'-nine tail the lord mayor have banquet and the practice of kiss the pope have toe
there be also something call the jus_primae_noctis which will probably not be mention in a textbook for child
it be the law by which every capitalist have the right to sleep with any woman work in one of his factory
how can you tell how much of it be lie
it must be true that the average human being be better off now than he have be before the revolution
the only evidence to the contrary be the mute protest in your own bone the instinctive feeling that the condition you live in be intolerable and that at some other time they must have be different
it strike him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life be not its cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness
life if you look about you bore no resemblance not only to the lie that stream out of the telescreen but even to the ideal that the party be try to achieve
great area of it even for a party member be neutral and non-political a matter of slog through dreary job fight for a place on the tube darn a worn-out sock cadge a saccharine tablet save a cigarette end
the ideal set up by the party be something huge terrible and glittering a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machine and terrifying weapon a nation of warrior and fanatic march forward in perfect unity all think the same thought and shout the same slogan perpetually work fight triumph persecute three hundred million people all with the same face
the reality be decay dingy city where underfed people shuffle to and fro in leaky shoe in patched-up nineteenth-century house that smell always of cabbage and bad lavatory
he seem to see a vision of London vast and ruinous city of a million dustbin and mix up with it be a picture of mrs Parsons a woman with line face and wispy hair fiddle helplessly with a block waste-pipe
he reach down and scratch his ankle again
day and night the telescreen bruise your ear with statistics prove that people today have more food more clothes good house good recreation that they live longer work short hour be big healthy strong happy more intelligent better educate than the people of fifty year ago
not a word of it can ever be prove or disprove
the party claim for example that today 40 per cent of adult prole be literate before the revolution it be say the number have only be 15 per cent
the party claim that the infant mortality rate be now only 160 per thousand whereas before the revolution it have be 300 and so it go on
it be like a single equation with two unknowns
it must very well be that literally every word in the history book even the thing that one accept without question be pure fantasy
for all he know there must never have be any such law as the jus_primae_noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat
everything fade into mist
the past be erase the erasure be forget the lie become truth
just once in his life he have possess after the event that be what count concrete unmistakable evidence of a act of falsification
he have hold it between his finger for as long as thirty second
in 1973 it must have be at any rate it be at about the time when he and katharine have part
but the really relevant date be seven or eight year early
the story really begin in the middle sixties the period of the great purge in which the original leader of the revolution be wipe out once and for all
by 1970 none of them be leave except big brother himself
all the rest have by that time be expose as traitor and counter-revolutionary
Goldstein have flee and be hide no one know where and of the others a few have simply disappear while the majority have be execute after spectacular public trial at which they make confession of their crime
among the last survivor be three man name jones aaronson and rutherford
it must have be in 1965 that these three have be arrest
as often happen they have vanish for a year or more so that one do not know whether they be alive or dead and then have suddenly be bring forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way
they have confess to intelligence with the enemy at that date too the enemy be Eurasia embezzlement of public fund the murder of various trusted party member intrigue against the leadership of big brother which have start long before the revolution happen and act of sabotage cause the death of hundred of thousand of people
after confess to these thing they have be pardon reinstate in the party and give post which be in fact sinecure but which sound important
all three have write long abject article in the Times analyse the reason for their defection and promise to make amend
some time after their release Winston have actually see all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe
he remember the sort of terrified fascination with which he have watch them out of the corner of his eye
they be man far old than himself relic of the ancient world almost the last great figure leave over from the heroic day of the party
the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly cling to them
he have the feeling though already at that time fact and date be grow blurry that he have know their name year early than he have know that of big brother
but also they be outlaw enemy untouchable doom with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two
no one who have once fall into the hand of the thought police ever escape in the end
they be corpse wait to be sent back to the grave
there be no one at any of the table near to them
it be not wise even to be see in the neighbourhood of such people
they be sit in silence before glass of the gin flavour with clove which be the speciality of the cafe
of the three it be rutherford whose appearance have most impress Winston
rutherford have once be a famous caricaturist whose brutal cartoon have help to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution
even now at long interval his cartoon be appear in the Times
they be simply a imitation of his early manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing
always they be a rehash of the ancient theme slum tenement starve child street battle capitalist in top hat even on the barricade the capitalist still seem to cling to their top hat a endless hopeless effort to get back into the past
he be a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair his face pouch and seam with thick negroid lip
at one time he must have be immensely strong now his great body be sag slope bulge fall away in every direction
he seem to be break up before one have eye like a mountain crumble
it be the lonely hour of fifteen
Winston can not now remember how he have come to be in the cafe at such a time
the place be almost empty
a tinny music be trickle from the telescreen
the three man sit in their corner almost motionless never speak
uncommand the waiter bring fresh glass of gin
there be a chessboard on the table beside them with the piece set out but no game start
and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happen to the telescreen
the tune that they be play change and the tone of the music change too
there come into it but it be something hard to describe
it be a peculiar cracked bray jeer note in his mind Winston call it a yellow note
and then a voice from the telescreen be sing
under the spread chestnut tree
I sell you and you sell me
there lie they and here lie we
under the spread chestnut tree
the three man never stir
but when Winston glance again at rutherford have ruinous face he see that his eye be full of tear
and for the first time he notice with a kind of inward shudder and yet not know at what he shudder that both aaronson and rutherford have broken nose
a little later all three be re-arrested
it appear that they have engage in fresh conspiracy from the very moment of their release
at their second trial they confess to all their old crime over again with a whole string of new one
they be execute and their fate be record in the party history a warning to posterity
about five year after this in 1973 Winston be unroll a wad of document which have just flop out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he come on a fragment of paper which have evidently be slip in among the others and then forget
the instant he have flatten it out he see its significance
it be a half-page tear out of the Times of about ten year early the top half of the page so that it include the date and it contain a photograph of the delegate at some party function in new York
prominent in the middle of the group be jones aaronson and rutherford
there be no mistake them in any case their name be in the caption at the bottom
the point be that at both trial all three man have confess that on that date they have be on Eurasian soil
they have fly from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia and have confer with member of the Eurasian general staff to whom they have betray important military secret
the date have stuck in Winston have memory because it chance to be midsummer day but the whole story must be on record in countless other place as well
there be only one possible conclusion the confession be lie
of course this be not in itself a discovery
even at that time Winston have not imagine that the people who be wipe out in the purge have actually commit the crime that they be accuse of
but this be concrete evidence it be a fragment of the abolish past like a fossil bone which turn up in the wrong stratum and destroy a geological theory
it be enough to blow the party to atom if in some way it can have be publish to the world and its significance make know
he have go straight on work
as soon as he see what the photograph be and what it mean he have cover it up with another sheet of paper
luckily when he unroll it it have be upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen
he take his scribble pad on his knee and push back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible
to keep your face expressionless be not difficult and even your breathing can be control with a effort but you can not control the beating of your heart and the telescreen be quite delicate enough to pick it up
he let what he judge to be ten minute go by torment all the while by the fear that some accident a sudden draught blow across his desk for instance will betray him
then without uncover it again he drop the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste paper
within another minute perhaps it will have crumble into ash
that be ten eleven year ago
today probably he will have keep that photograph
it be curious that the fact of have hold it in his finger seem to him to make a difference even now when the photograph itself as well as the event it record be only memory
be the party have hold upon the past less strong he wonder because a piece of evidence which exist no longer have once exist
but today supposing that it can be somehow resurrect from its ash the photograph must not even be evidence
already at the time when he make his discovery Oceania be no longer at war with Eurasia and it must have be to the agent of Eastasia that the three dead man have betray their country
since then there have be other change two three he can not remember how many
Very likely the confession have be rewrite and rewrite until the original fact and date no longer have the small significance
the past not only change but change continuously
what most afflict him with the sense of nightmare be that he have never clearly understand why the huge imposture be undertake
the immediate advantage of falsify the past be obvious but the ultimate motive be mysterious
he take up his pen again and write
I understand how I do not understand why
he wonder as he have many time wonder before whether he himself be a lunatic
perhaps a lunatic be simply a minority of one
at one time it have be a sign of madness to believe that the earth go round the sun today to believe that the past be inalterable
he must be alone in hold that belief and if alone then a lunatic
but the thought of be a lunatic do not greatly trouble him the horror be that he must also be wrong
he pick up the child have history book and look at the portrait of big brother which form its frontispiece
the hypnotic eye gaze into his own
it be as though some huge force be press down upon you something that penetrate inside your skull batter against your brain frighten you out of your belief persuade you almost to deny the evidence of your sense
in the end the party will announce that two and two make five and you will have to believe it
it be inevitable that they shall make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demand it
not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality be tacit deny by their philosophy
the heresy of heresy be common sense
and what be terrifying be not that they will kill you for think otherwise but that they must be right
for after all how do we know that two and two make four
or that the force of gravity work
or that the past be unchangeable
if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself be controllable what then
but no
his courage seem suddenly to stiffen of its own accord
the face of O'Brien not call up by any obvious association have float into his mind
he know with more certainty than before that O'Brien be on his side
he be write the diary for O'Brien to O'Brien it be like a interminable letter which no one will ever read but which be address to a particular person and take its colour from that fact
the party tell you to reject the evidence of your eye and ear
it be their final most essential command
his heart sink as he think of the enormous power array against him the ease with which any party intellectual will overthrow him in debate the subtle argument which he will not be able to understand much less answer
and yet he be in the right
they be wrong and he be right
the obvious the silly and the true have get to be defend
truism be true hold on to that
the solid world exist its law do not change
stone be hard water be wet object unsupported fall towards the earth have centre
with the feeling that he be speak to O'Brien and also that he be set forth a important axiom he write
freedom be the freedom to say that two plus two make four
if that be grant all else follow
from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roast coffee real coffee not victory coffee come float out into the street
Winston pause involuntarily
for perhaps two second he be back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood
then a door bang seem to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it have be a sound
he have walk several kilometre over pavement and his varicose ulcer be throb
this be the second time in three week that he have miss a evening at the community centre a rash act since you can be certain that the number of your attendance at the centre be carefully check
in principle a party member have no spare time and be never alone except in bed
it be assume that when he be not work eat or sleep he will be take part in some kind of communal recreation to do anything that suggest a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourself be always slightly dangerous
there be a word for it in Newspeak ownlife it be call mean individualism and eccentricity
but this evening as he come out of the ministry the balminess of the April air have tempt him
the sky be a warm blue than he have see it that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhaust game the lecture the creak camaraderie oil by gin have seem intolerable
on impulse he have turn away from the bus-stop and wander off into the labyrinth of London first south then east then north again lose himself among unknown street and hardly bother in which direction he be go
if there be hope he have write in the diary it lie in the prole
the word keep come back to him statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity
he be somewhere in the vague brown-coloured slum to the north and east of what have once be saint pancras station
he be walk up a cobble street of little two-storey house with battered doorway which give straight on the pavement and which be somehow curiously suggestive of rathole
there be puddle of filthy water here and there among the cobble
in and out of the dark doorway and down narrow alley-way that branch off on either side people swarm in astonishing number girl in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouth and youth who chase the girl and swollen waddle woman who show you what the girl will be like in ten year have time and old bent creature shuffle along on splay foot and ragged barefooted child who play in the puddle and then scatter at angry yell from their mother
perhaps a quarter of the window in the street be broken and board up
most of the people pay no attention to Winston a few eye him with a sort of guarded curiosity
two monstrous woman with brick-red forearm fold across their apron be talk outside a doorway
Winston catch scrap of conversation as he approach
yes I say to her that be all very well I say
but if you have of be in my place you have of do the same as what I do
it be easy to criticize I say but you have+not get the same problem as what I get
ah say the other that be jest it
that be jest where it be
the strident voice stop abruptly
the woman study him in hostile silence as he go past
but it be not hostility exactly merely a kind of wariness a momentary stiffen as at the pass of some unfamiliar animal
the blue overall of the party can not be a common sight in a street like this
indeed it be unwise to be see in such place unless you have definite business there
the patrol must stop you if you happen to run into them
May I see your paper comrade
what be you do here
what time do you leave work
be this your usual way home
and so on and so forth
not that there be any rule against walk home by a unusual route but it be enough to draw attention to you if the thought police hear about it
suddenly the whole street be in commotion
there be yell of warning from all side
people be shoot into the doorway like rabbit
a young woman leap out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston grab up a tiny child play in a puddle whip her apron round it and leap back again all in one movement
at the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit who have emerge from a side alley run towards Winston point excited to the sky
steamer he yell
look out guv'nor
bang over'ead
lie down quick
steamer be a nickname which for some reason the prole apply to rocket bomb
Winston promptly fling himself on his face
the prole be nearly always right when they give you a warning of this kind
they seem to possess some kind of instinct which tell them several second in advance when a rocket be come although the rocket supposedly travel fast than sound
Winston clasp his forearm above his head
there be a roar that seem to make the pavement heave a shower of light object patter on to his back
when he stand up he found that he be cover with fragment of glass from the near window
he walk on
the bomb have demolish a group of house 200 metre up the street
a black plume of smoke hang in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd be already form around the ruin
there be a little pile of plaster lie on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he can see a bright red streak
when he get up to it he see that it be a human hand sever at the wrist
apart from the bloody stump the hand be so completely whiten as to resemble a plaster cast
he kick the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turn down a side-street to the right
within three or four minute he be out of the area which the bomb have affect and the sordid swarm life of the street be go on as though nothing have happen
it be nearly twenty hour and the drinking-shops which the prole frequent pub they call them be choke with customer
from their grimy swing door endlessly open and shut there come forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer
in a angle form by a project house-front three man be stand very close together the middle one of them hold a folded-up newspaper which the other two be study over his shoulder
even before he be near enough to make out the expression on their face Winston can see absorption in every line of their body
it be obviously some serious piece of news that they be read
he be a few paces away from them when suddenly the group break up and two of the man be in violent altercation
for a moment they seem almost on the point of blow
can+not you bleed well listen to what I say
I tell you no number end in seven have+not win for over fourteen month
yes it have have then
no it have have not
back 'ome I get the 'ole lot of them for over two year write down on a piece of paper
I take them down reg'lar as the clock
an' I tell you no number end in seven
yes a seven have win
I can pretty near tell you the bleed number
four oh seven it end in
it be in February second week in February
February your grandmother
I get it all down in black and white
an' I tell you no number
oh pack it in say the third man
they be talk about the lottery
Winston look back when he have go thirty metre
they be still argue with vivid passionate face
the lottery with its weekly pay-out of enormous prize be the one public event to which the prole pay serious attention
it be probable that there be some million of prole for whom the lottery be the principal if not the only reason for remain alive
it be their delight their folly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant
where the lottery be concern even people who can barely read and write seem capable of intricate calculation and staggering feat of memory
there be a whole tribe of man who make a living simply by sell system forecast and lucky amulet
Winston have nothing to do with the running of the lottery which be manage by the ministry of plenty but he be aware indeed everyone in the party be aware that the prize be largely imaginary
only small sum be actually pay out the winner of the big prize be non-existent person
in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another this be not difficult to arrange
but if there be hope it lie in the prole
you have to cling on to that
when you put it in word it sound reasonable it be when you look at the human being pass you on the pavement that it become a act of faith
the street into which he have turn run downhill
he have a feeling that he have be in this neighbourhood before and that there be a main thoroughfare not far away
from somewhere ahead there come a din of shout voice
the street take a sharp turn and then end in a flight of step which lead down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeeper be sell tired-looking vegetable
at this moment Winston remember where he be
the alley lead out into the main street and down the next turning not five minute away be the junk-shop where he have buy the blank book which be now his diary
and in a small stationer have shop not far away he have buy his penholder and his bottle of ink
he pause for a moment at the top of the step
on the opposite side of the alley there be a dingy little pub whose window appear to be frost over but in reality be merely coat with dust
a very old man bent but active with white moustache that bristle forward like those of a prawn push open the swing door and go in
as Winston stand watch it occur to him that the old man who must be eighty at the least have already be middle-aged when the revolution happen
he and a few others like him be the last link that now exist with the vanish world of capitalism
in the party itself there be not many people leave whose idea have be form before the revolution
the old generation have mostly be wipe out in the great purge of the fifty and sixties and the few who survive have long ago be terrify into complete intellectual surrender
if there be any one still alive who can give you a truthful account of condition in the early part of the century it can only be a prole
suddenly the passage from the history book that he have copy into his diary come back into Winston have mind and a lunatic impulse take hold of him
he will go into the pub he will scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him
he will say to him tell me about your life when you be a boy
what be it like in those day
be thing good than they be now or be they bad
hurriedly lest he shall have time to become frightened he descend the step and cross the narrow street
it be madness of course
as usual there be no definite rule against talk to prole and frequent their pub but it be far too unusual a action to pass unnoticed
if the patrol appear he must plead a attack of faintness but it be not likely that they will believe him
he push open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face
as he enter the din of voice drop to about half its volume
behind his back he can feel everyone eye his blue overall
a game of darts which be go on at the other end of the room interrupt itself for perhaps as much as thirty second
the old man whom he have follow be stand at the bar have some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hook-nosed young man with enormous forearm
a knot of others stand round with glass in their hand be watch the scene
I ask you civil enough do+not I
say the old man straighten his shoulder pugnaciously
you tell me you have+not get a pint mug in the 'ole bleed boozer
and what in hell have name be a pint
say the barman lean forward with the tip of his finger on the counter
ark at him
call himself a barman and do+not know what a pint be
why a pint be the 'alf of a quart and there be four quart to the gallon
have to teach you the a B c next
never hear of them say the barman shortly
litre and half litre that be all we serve
there be the glass on the shelf in front of you
I like a pint persist the old man
you can 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough
we do+not 'ave these bleed litre when I be a young man
when you be a young man we be all live in the treetop say the barman with a glance at the other customer
there be a shout of laughter and the uneasiness cause by Winston have entry seem to disappear
the old man have whitestubbled face have flush pink
he turn away mutter to himself and bump into Winston
Winston catch him gently by the arm
May I offer you a drink
he say
you be a gent say the other straighten his shoulder again
he appear not to have notice Winston have blue overall
pint he add aggressively to the barman
pint of wallop
the barman swish two half-litre of dark-brown beer into thick glass which he have rinse in a bucket under the counter
beer be the only drink you can get in prole pub
the prole be supposed not to drink gin though in practice they can get hold of it easily enough
the game of darts be in full swing again and the knot of man at the bar have begin talk about lottery ticket
Winston have presence be forget for a moment
there be a deal table under the window where he and the old man can talk without fear of be overhear
it be horribly dangerous but at any rate there be no telescreen in the room a point he have make sure of as soon as he come in
he can 'a drawed me off a pint grumble the old man as he settle down behind a glass
a 'alf litre be+not enough
it do+not satisfy
and a 'ole litre be too much
it start my bladder run
let alone the price
you must have see great change since you be a young man say Winston tentatively
the old man have pale blue eye move from the darts board to the bar and from the bar to the door of the gent as though it be in the bar-room that he expect the change to have occur
the beer be good he say finally
and cheap
when I be a young man mild beer wallop we use to call it be fourpence a pint
that be before the war of course
which war be that
say Winston
it be all war say the old man vague
he take up his glass and his shoulder straighten again
here be wish you the very good of 'ealth
in his lean throat the sharp-pointed adam have apple make a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement and the beer vanish
Winston go to the bar and come back with two more half-litre
the old man appear to have forget his prejudice against drink a full litre
you be very much old than I be say Winston
you must have be a grown man before I be born
you can remember what it be like in the old day before the revolution
people of my age do+not really know anything about those time
we can only read about them in book and what it say in the book may not be true
I shall like your opinion on that
the history book say that life before the revolution be completely different from what it be now
there be the most terrible oppression injustice poverty bad than anything we can imagine
here in London the great mass of the people never have enough to eat from birth to death
half of them have+not even boot on their foot
they work twelve hour a day they leave school at nine they sleep ten in a room
and at the same time there be a very few people only a few thousand the capitalist they be call who be rich and powerful
they own everything that there be to own
they live in great gorgeous house with thirty servant they ride about in motor-car and four-horse carriage they drink champagne they wear top hat
the old man brighten suddenly
top hat he say
funny you shall mention them
the same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday I dono why
I be jest think I have+not see a top hat in year
go right out they 'ave
the last time I wear one be at my sister-in-law have funeral
and that be well I could+not give you the date but it must 'a be fifty year ago
of course it be only hire for the occasion you understand
it be+not very important about the top hat say Winston patiently
the point be these capitalist they and a few lawyer and priest and so forth who live on them be the lord of the earth
everything exist for their benefit
you the ordinary people the worker be their slave
they can do what they like with you
they can ship you off to Canada like cattle
they can sleep with your daughter if they choose
they can order you to be flog with something call a cat-o'-nine tail
you have to take your cap off when you pass them
every capitalist go about with a gang of lackey who
the old man brighten again
lackey he say
now there be a word I have+not hear since ever so long
lackey
that reg'lar take me back that do
I recollect oh donkey have year ago I use to sometimes go to Hyde_Park of a Sunday afternoon to hear the bloke make speech
salvation army Roman Catholic Jew Indian all sort there be
and there be one bloke well I could+not give you his name but a real powerful speaker he be
he do+not 'alf give it them
lackey he say lackey of the bourgeoisie
flunky of the ruling class
parasite that be another of them
and 'yenas he definitely call them 'yenas
of course he be refer to the labour party you understand
Winston have the feeling that they be talk at crosspurposes
what I really want to know be this he say
do you feel that you have more freedom now than you have in those day
be you treat more like a human being
in the old day the rich people the people at the top
the house of Lords put in the old man reminiscent
the house of Lords if you like
what I be ask be be these people able to treat you as a inferior simply because they be rich and you be poor
be it a fact for instance that you have to call them sir and take off your cap when you pass them
the old man appear to think deeply
he drink off about a quarter of his beer before answer
yes he say
they like you to touch your cap to them
it show respect like
I do+not agree with it myself but I do it often enough
have to as you must say
and be it usual I be only quote what I have read in history book be it usual for these people and their servant to push you off the pavement into the gutter
one of them push me once say the old man
I recollect it as if it be yesterday
it be boat race night terribly rowdy they use to get on boat race night and I bump into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue
quite a gent he be dress shirt top hat black overcoat
he be kind of zig-zagging across the pavement and I bump into him accidental-like
he say why can+not you look where you be go
he say
I say ju think you have buy the bleed pavement
he say I will twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me
I say you be drunk
I will give you in charge in 'alf a minute I say
an' if you will believe me he put his hand on my chest and give me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheel of a bus
well I be young in them day and I be go to 'ave fetch him one only
a sense of helplessness take hold of Winston
the old man have memory be nothing but a rubbish-heap of detail
one can question him all day without get any real information
the party history must still be true after a fashion they must even be completely true
he make a last attempt
perhaps I have not make myself clear he say
what I be try to say be this
you have be alive a very long time you live half your life before the revolution
in 1925 for instance you be already grown up
will you say from what you can remember that life in 1925 be good than it be now or bad
if you can choose will you prefer to live then or now
the old man look meditative at the darts board
he finish up his beer more slowly than before
when he speak it be with a tolerant philosophical air as though the beer have mellow him
I know what you expect me to say he say
you expect me to say as I will sooner be young again
most people will say they will sooner be young if you be have them
you get your 'ealth and strength when you be young
when you get to my time of life you be+not never well
I suffer something wicked from my foot and my bladder be jest terrible
six and seven time a night it have me out of bed
on the other hand there be great advantage in be a old man
you have+not get the same worry
no truck with woman and that be a great thing
I have+not have a woman for near on thirty year if you will credit it
nor want to what be more
Winston sit back against the window-sill
it be no use go on
he be about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly get up and shuffle rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room
the extra half-litre be already work on him
Winston sit for a minute or two gaze at his empty glass and hardly notice when his foot carry him out into the street again
within twenty year at the most he reflect the huge and simple question be life good before the revolution than it be now
will have cease once and for all to be answerable
but in effect it be unanswerable even now since the few scattered survivor from the ancient world be incapable of compare one age with another
they remember a million useless thing a quarrel with a workmate a hunt for a lost bicycle pump the expression on a long-dead sister have face the swirl of dust on a windy morning seventy year ago but all the relevant fact be outside the range of their vision
they be like the ant which can see small object but not large one
and when memory fail and write record be falsify when that happen the claim of the party to have improve the condition of human life have get to be accept because there do not exist and never again can exist any standard against which it can be test
at this moment his train of thought stop abruptly
he halt and look up
he be in a narrow street with a few dark little shop intersperse among dwelling-house
immediately above his head there hang three discoloured metal ball which look as if they have once be gild
he seem to know the place
of course
he be stand outside the junk-shop where he have buy the diary
a twinge of fear go through him
it have be a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he have sworn never to come near the place again
and yet the instant that he allow his thought to wander his foot have bring him back here of their own accord
it be precisely against suicidal impulse of this kind that he have hope to guard himself by open the diary
at the same time he notice that although it be nearly twenty-one hour the shop be still open
with the feeling that he will be less conspicuous inside than hang about on the pavement he step through the doorway
if question he can plausibly say that he be try to buy razor blade
the proprietor have just light a hanging oil lamp which give off a unclean but friendly smell
he be a man of perhaps sixty frail and bow with a long benevolent nose and mild eye distort by thick spectacle
his hair be almost white but his eyebrow be bushy and still black
his spectacle his gentle fussy movement and the fact that he be wear a aged jacket of black velvet give him a vague air of intellectuality as though he have be some kind of literary man or perhaps a musician
his voice be soft as though faded and his accent less debased than that of the majority of prole
I recognize you on the pavement he say immediately
you be the gentleman that buy the young lady have keepsake album
that be a beautiful bit of paper that be
cream-laid it use to be call
there have be no paper like that make for oh I dare say fifty year
he peer at Winston over the top of his spectacle
be there anything special I can do for you
or do you just want to look round
I be pass say Winston vague
I just look in
I do+not want anything in particular
it be just as well say the other because I do+not suppose I can have satisfy you
he make a apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand
you see how it be a empty shop you must say
between you and me the antique trade be just about finished
no demand any longer and no stock either
furniture china glass it be all be break up by degree
and of course the metal stuff have mostly be melt down
I have+not see a brass candlestick in year
the tiny interior of the shop be in fact uncomfortably full but there be almost nothing in it of the slight value
the floorspace be very restricted because all round the wall be stack innumerable dusty picture-frame
in the window there be tray of nut and bolt worn-out chisel penknife with broken blade tarnished watch that do not even pretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish
only on a small table in the corner be there a litter of odds and end lacquered snuffbox agate brooch and the like which look as though they must include something interesting
as Winston wander towards the table his eye be catch by a round smooth thing that gleam softly in the lamplight and he pick it up
it be a heavy lump of glass curve on one side flat on the other make almost a hemisphere
there be a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour and the texture of the glass
at the heart of it magnify by the curved surface there be a strange pink convoluted object that recall a rose or a sea anemone
what be it
say Winston fascinate
that be coral that be say the old man
it must have come from the Indian ocean
they use to kind of embed it in the glass
that be+not make less than a hundred year ago
more by the look of it
it be a beautiful thing say Winston
it be a beautiful thing say the other appreciatively
but there be not many that will say so nowadays
he cough
now if it so happen that you want to buy it that will cost you four dollar
I can remember when a thing like that will have fetch eight pound and eight pound be well I can+not work it out but it be a lot of money
but who care about genuine antique nowadays even the few that be leave
Winston immediately pay over the four dollar and slide the covet thing into his pocket
what appeal to him about it be not so much its beauty as the air it seem to possess of belong to a age quite different from the present one
the soft rainwatery glass be not like any glass that he have ever see
the thing be doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness though he can guess that it must once have be intend as a paperweight
it be very heavy in his pocket but fortunately it do not make much of a bulge
it be a queer thing even a compromising thing for a party member to have in his possession
anything old and for that matter anything beautiful be always vague suspect
the old man have grown noticeably more cheerful after receive the four dollar
Winston realize that he will have accept three or even two
there be another room upstairs that you must care to take a look at he say
there be not much in it
just a few piece
we will do with a light if we be go upstairs
he light another lamp and with bowed back lead the way slowly up the steep and wear stair and along a tiny passage into a room which do not give on the street but look out on a cobble yard and a forest of chimney-pots
Winston notice that the furniture be still arrange as though the room be mean to be live in
there be a strip of carpet on the floor a picture or two on the wall and a deep slatternly arm-chair draw up to the fireplace
a old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face be tick away on the mantelpiece
under the window and occupy nearly a quarter of the room be a enormous bed with the mattress still on it
we live here till my wife die say the old man half apologetically
I be sell the furniture off by little and little
now that be a beautiful mahogany bed or at least it will be if you can get the bug out of it
but I dare say you will find it a little bit cumbersome
he be hold the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and in the warm dim light the place look curiously inviting
the thought flit through Winston have mind that it will probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollar a week if he dare to take the risk
it be a wild impossible notion to be abandon as soon as think of but the room have awaken in him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory
it seem to him that he know exactly what it feel like to sit in a room like this in a arm-chair beside a open fire with your foot in the fender and a kettle on the hob utterly alone utterly secure with nobody watch you no voice pursue you no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly tick of the clock
there be no telescreen he can not help murmur
ah say the old man I never have one of those thing
too expensive
and I never seem to feel the need of it somehow
now that be a nice gateleg table in the corner there
though of course you will have to put new hinge on it if you want to use the flap
there be a small bookcase in the other corner and Winston have already gravitate towards it
it contain nothing but rubbish
the hunting-down and destruction of book have be do with the same thoroughness in the prole quarter as everywhere else
it be very unlikely that there exist anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book print early than 1960
the old man still carry the lamp be stand in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hang on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bed
now if you happen to be interested in old print at all he begin delicately
Winston come across to examine the picture
it be a steel engraving of a oval building with rectangular window and a small tower in front
there be a railing run round the building and at the rear end there be what appear to be a statue
Winston gaze at it for some moment
it seem vague familiar though he do not remember the statue
the frame have fixed to the wall say the old man but I can unscrew it for you I dare say
I know that building say Winston finally
it be a ruin now
it be in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice
that be right
outside the law court
it be bomb in oh many year ago
it be a church at one time st clement Dane its name be
he smile apologetically as though conscious of say something slightly ridiculous and add orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
what be that
say Winston
oh orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
that be a rhyme we have when I be a little boy
how it go on I do+not remember but I do know it end up here come a candle to light you to bed here come a chopper to chop off your head
it be a kind of a dance
they hold out their arm for you to pass under and when they come to here come a chopper to chop off your head they bring their arm down and catch you
it be just name of church
all the London church be in it all the principal one that be
Winston wonder vague to what century the church belong
it be always difficult to determine the age of a London building
anything large and impressive if it be reasonably new in appearance be automatically claim as have be build since the revolution while anything that be obviously of early date be ascribe to some dim period call the middle age
the century of capitalism be hold to have produce nothing of any value
one can not learn history from architecture any more than one can learn it from book
statue inscription memorial stone the name of street anything that must throw light upon the past have be systematically alter
I never know it have be a church he say
there be a lot of them leave really say the old man though they have be put to other use
now how do that rhyme go
ah
I have get it
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
you owe me three farthing say the bell of st martin have
there now that be as far as I can get
a farthing that be a small copper coin look something like a cent
where be st martin have
say Winston
st martin have
that be still stand
it be in victory square alongside the picture gallery
a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillar in front and a big flight of step
Winston know the place well
it be a museum use for propaganda display of various kind scale model of rocket bomb and floating fortress waxwork tableau illustrate enemy atrocity and the like
st Martin's-in-the-Fields it use to be call supplement the old man though I do+not recollect any field anywhere in those part
Winston do not buy the picture
it will have be a even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home unless it be take out of its frame
but he linger for some minute more talk to the old man whose name he discover be not week as one must have gather from the inscription over the shop-front but charrington
Mister charrington it seem be a widower aged sixty-three and have inhabit this shop for thirty year
throughout that time he have be intend to alter the name over the window but have never quite get to the point of do it
all the while that they be talk the half-remembered rhyme keep run through Winston have head
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have you owe me three farthing say the bell of st martin have
it be curious but when you say it to yourself you have the illusion of actually hear bell the bell of a lost London that still exist somewhere or other disguise and forget
from one ghostly steeple after another he seem to hear them peal forth
yet so far as he can remember he have never in real life hear church bell ring
he get away from Mister charrington and go down the stair alone so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitre the street before step out of the door
he have already make up his mind that after a suitable interval a month say he will take the risk of visit the shop again
it be perhaps not more dangerous than shirk a evening at the centre
the serious piece of folly have be to come back here in the first place after buy the diary and without know whether the proprietor of the shop can be trust
however
yes he think again he will come back
he will buy further scrap of beautiful rubbish
he will buy the engraving of st clement Dane take it out of its frame and carry it home conceal under the jacket of his overall
he will drag the rest of that poem out of Mister charrington have memory
even the lunatic project of rent the room upstairs flash momentarily through his mind again
for perhaps five second exaltation make him careless and he step out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window
he have even start hum to a improvise tune
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
you owe me three farthing say the
suddenly his heart seem to turn to ice and his bowel to water
a figure in blue overall be come down the pavement not ten metre away
it be the girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair
the light be failing but there be no difficulty in recognize her
she look him straight in the face then walk quickly on as though she have not see him
for a few second Winston be too paralysed to move
then he turn to the right and walk heavily away not notice for the moment that he be go in the wrong direction
at any rate one question be settle
there be no doubt any longer that the girl be spy on him
she must have follow him here because it be not credible that by pure chance she shall have happen to be walk on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet kilometre distant from any quarter where party member live
it be too great a coincidence
whether she be really a agent of the thought police or simply a amateur spy actuate by officiousness hardly matter
it be enough that she be watch him
probably she have see him go into the pub as well
it be a effort to walk
the lump of glass in his pocket bang against his thigh at each step and he be half minded to take it out and throw it away
the bad thing be the pain in his belly
for a couple of minute he have the feeling that he will die if he do not reach a lavatory soon
but there will be no public lavatory in a quarter like this
then the spasm pass leave a dull ache behind
the street be a blind alley
Winston halt stand for several second wonder vague what to do then turn round and begin to retrace his step
as he turn it occur to him that the girl have only pass him three minute ago and that by run he can probably catch up with her
he can keep on her track till they be in some quiet place and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone
the piece of glass in his pocket will be heavy enough for the job
but he abandon the idea immediately because even the thought of make any physical effort be unbearable
he can not run he can not strike a blow
besides she be young and lusty and will defend herself
he think also of hurry to the community centre and stay there till the place close so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening
but that too be impossible
a deadly lassitude have take hold of him
all he want be to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet
it be after twenty-two hour when he get back to the flat
the light will be switch off at the main at twenty-three thirty
he go into the kitchen and swallow nearly a teacupful of victory gin
then he go to the table in the alcove sit down and take the diary out of the drawer
but he do not open it at once
from the telescreen a brassy female voice be squall a patriotic song
he sit stare at the marbled cover of the book try without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness
it be at night that they come for you always at night
the proper thing be to kill yourself before they get you
undoubtedly some people do so
many of the disappearance be actually suicide
but it need desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearm or any quick and certain poison be completely unprocurable
he think with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which always freeze into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort be need
he must have silence the dark-haired girl if only he have act quickly enough but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he have lose the power to act
it strike him that in moment of crisis one be never fight against a external enemy but always against one have own body
even now in spite of the gin the dull ache in his belly make consecutive thought impossible
and it be the same he perceive in all seemingly heroic or tragic situation
on the battlefield in the torture chamber on a sink ship the issue that you be fight for be always forget because the body swell up until it fill the universe and even when you be not paralyse by fright or scream with pain life be a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or a ache tooth
he open the diary
it be important to write something down
the woman on the telescreen have start a new song
her voice seem to stick into his brain like jagged splinter of glass
he try to think of O'Brien for whom or to whom the diary be write but instead he begin think of the thing that will happen to him after the thought police take him away
it will not matter if they kill you at once
to be kill be what you expect
but before death nobody speak of such thing yet everybody know of them there be the routine of confession that have to be go through the grovel on the floor and scream for mercy the crack of broken bone the smash tooth and bloody clot of hair
why do you have to endure it since the end be always the same
why be it not possible to cut a few day or week out of your life
nobody ever escape detection and nobody ever fail to confess
when once you have succumb to thoughtcrime it be certain that by a give date you will be dead
why then do that horror which alter nothing have to lie embed in future time
he try with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien
we shall meet in the place where there be no darkness O'Brien have say to him
he know what it mean or think he know
the place where there be no darkness be the imagine future which one will never see but which by foreknowledge one can mystically share in
but with the voice from the telescreen nag at his ear he can not follow the train of thought further
he put a cigarette in his mouth
half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which be difficult to spit out again
the face of big brother swim into his mind displace that of O'Brien
just as he have do a few day early he slide a coin out of his pocket and look at it
the face gaze up at him heavy calm protect but what kind of smile be hide beneath the dark moustache
like a leaden knell the word come back at him war be peace freedom be slavery ignorance be strength
it be the middle of the morning and Winston have leave the cubicle to go to the lavatory
a solitary figure be come towards him from the other end of the long brightly-lit corridor
it be the girl with dark hair
four day have go past since the evening when he have run into her outside the junk-shop
as she come nearer he see that her right arm be in a sling not noticeable at a distance because it be of the same colour as her overall
probably she have crush her hand while swing round one of the big kaleidoscope on which the plot of novel be rough in
it be a common accident in the fiction department
they be perhaps four metre apart when the girl stumble and fall almost flat on her face
a sharp cry of pain be wrung out of her
she must have fall right on the injured arm
Winston stop short
the girl have rise to her knee
her face have turn a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stand out red than ever
her eye be fix on his with a appealing expression that look more like fear than pain
a curious emotion stir in Winston have heart
in front of him be a enemy who be try to kill him in front of him also be a human creature in pain and perhaps with a broken bone
already he have instinctively start forward to help her
in the moment when he have see her fall on the bandage arm it have be as though he feel the pain in his own body
you be hurt
he say
it be nothing
my arm
it will be all right in a second
she speak as though her heart be flutter
she have certainly turn very pale
you have+not break anything
no I be all right
it hurt for a moment that be all
she hold out her free hand to him and he help her up
she have regain some of her colour and appear very much good
it be nothing she repeat shortly
I only give my wrist a bit of a bang
thanks comrade
and with that she walk on in the direction in which she have be go as briskly as though it have really be nothing
the whole incident can not have take as much as half a minute
not to let one have feeling appear in one have face be a habit that have acquire the status of a instinct and in any case they have be stand straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happen
nevertheless it have be very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two or three second while he be help her up the girl have slip something into his hand
there be no question that she have do it intentionally
it be something small and flat
as he pass through the lavatory door he transfer it to his pocket and feel it with the tip of his finger
it be a scrap of paper fold into a square
while he stand at the urinal he manage with a little more finger to get it unfold
obviously there must be a message of some kind write on it
for a moment he be tempt to take it into one of the water-closet and read it at once
but that will be shocking folly as he well know
there be no place where you can be more certain that the telescreen be watch continuously
he go back to his cubicle sit down throw the fragment of paper casually among the other paper on the desk put on his spectacle and hitch the speakwrite towards him five minute he tell himself five minute at the very least
his heart bump in his breast with frighten loudness
fortunately the piece of work he be engaged on be mere routine the rectification of a long list of figure not need close attention
whatever be write on the paper it must have some kind of political meaning
so far as he can see there be two possibility
one much the more likely be that the girl be a agent of the thought police just as he have fear
he do not know why the thought police shall choose to deliver their message in such a fashion but perhaps they have their reason
the thing that be write on the paper must be a threat a summons a order to commit suicide a trap of some description
but there be another wild possibility that keep raise its head though he try vainly to suppress it
this be that the message do not come from the thought police at all but from some kind of underground organization
perhaps the brotherhood exist after all
perhaps the girl be part of it
no doubt the idea be absurd but it have spring into his mind in the very instant of feel the scrap of paper in his hand
it be not till a couple of minute later that the other more probable explanation have occur to him
and even now though his intellect tell him that the message probably mean death still that be not what he believe and the unreasonable hope persist and his heart bang and it be with difficulty that he keep his voice from tremble as he murmur his figure into the speakwrite
he roll up the complete bundle of work and slide it into the pneumatic tube
eight minute have go by
he re-adjusted his spectacle on his nose sigh and draw the next batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper on top of it
he flatten it out
on it be write in a large unformed handwriting I love you
for several second he be too stunned even to throw the incriminate thing into the memory hole
when he do so although he know very well the danger of show too much interest he can not resist read it once again just to make sure that the word be really there
for the rest of the morning it be very difficult to work
what be even bad than have to focus his mind on a series of niggling job be the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen
he feel as though a fire be burn in his belly
lunch in the hot crowded noise-filled canteen be torment
he have hope to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck will have it the imbecile Parsons flop down beside him the tang of his sweat almost defeat the tinny smell of stew and keep up a stream of talk about the preparation for hate week
he be particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of big brother have head two metre wide which be be make for the occasion by his daughter have troop of spy
the irritate thing be that in the racket of voice Winston can hardly hear what Parsons be say and be constantly have to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeat
just once he catch a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girl at the far end of the room
she appear not to have see him and he do not look in that direction again
the afternoon be more bearable
immediately after lunch there arrive a delicate difficult piece of work which will take several hour and necessitate put everything else aside
it consist in falsify a series of production report of two year ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who be now under a cloud
this be the kind of thing that Winston be good at and for more than two hour he succeed in shut the girl out of his mind altogether
then the memory of her face come back and with it a rage intolerable desire to be alone
until he can be alone it be impossible to think this new development out
tonight be one of his night at the community centre
he wolf another tasteless meal in the canteen hurry off to the centre take part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group play two game of table tennis swallow several glass of gin and sit for half a hour through a lecture entitle Ingsoc in relation to chess
his soul writhe with boredom but for once he have have no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre
at the sight of the word I love you the desire to stay alive have well up in him and the taking of minor risk suddenly seem stupid
it be not till twenty-three hour when he be home and in bed in the darkness where you be safe even from the telescreen so long as you keep silent that he be able to think continuously
it be a physical problem that have to be solve how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting
he do not consider any longer the possibility that she must be lay some kind of trap for him
he know that it be not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she hand him the note
obviously she have be frighten out of her wit as well she must be
nor do the idea of refuse her advance even cross his mind
only five night ago he have contemplate smash her skull in with a cobblestone but that be of no importance
he think of her naked youthful body as he have see it in his dream
he have imagine her a fool like all the rest of them her head stuff with lie and hatred her belly full of ice
a kind of fever seize him at the thought that he must lose her the white youthful body must slip away from him
what he fear more than anything else be that she will simply change her mind if he do not get in touch with her quickly
but the physical difficulty of meet be enormous
it be like try to make a move at chess when you be already mate
whichever way you turn the telescreen face you
actually all the possible way of communicate with her have occur to him within five minute of read the note but now with time to think he go over them one by one as though lay out a row of instrument on a table
obviously the kind of encounter that have happen this morning can not be repeat
if she have work in the record department it must have be comparatively simple but he have only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lie and he have no pretext for go there
if he have know where she live and at what time she leave work he can have contrive to meet her somewhere on her way home but to try to follow her home be not safe because it will mean loiter about outside the ministry which be bound to be notice
as for sent a letter through the mail it be out of the question
by a routine that be not even secret all letter be open in transit
actually few people ever write letter
for the message that it be occasionally necessary to sent there be printed postcard with long list of phrase and you strike out the one that be inapplicable
in any case he do not know the girl have name let alone her address
finally he decide that the safe place be the canteen
if he can get her at a table by herself somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreen and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round if these condition endure for say thirty second it must be possible to exchange a few word
for a week after this life be like a restless dream
on the next day she do not appear in the canteen until he be leave it the whistle have already blow
presumably she have be change on to a late shift
they pass each other without a glance
on the day after that she be in the canteen at the usual time but with three other girl and immediately under a telescreen
then for three dreadful day she do not appear at all
his whole mind and body seem to be afflict with a unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which make every movement every sound every contact every word that he have to speak or listen to a agony
even in sleep he can not altogether escape from her image
he do not touch the diary during those day
if there be any relief it be in his work in which he can sometimes forget himself for ten minute at a stretch
he have absolutely no clue as to what have happen to her
there be no enquiry he can make
she must have be vaporize she must have commit suicide she must have be transfer to the other end of Oceania bad and likely of all she must simply have change her mind and decide to avoid him
the next day she reappear
her arm be out of the sling and she have a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist
the relief of see her be so great that he can not resist stare directly at her for several second
on the following day he very nearly succeed in speak to her
when he come into the canteen she be sit at a table well out from the wall and be quite alone
it be early and the place be not very full
the queue edge forward till Winston be almost at the counter then be hold up for two minute because someone in front be complain that he have not receive his tablet of saccharine
but the girl be still alone when Winston secure his tray and begin to make for her table
he walk casually towards her his eye search for a place at some table beyond her
she be perhaps three metre away from him
another two second will do it
then a voice behind him call Smith
he pretend not to hear
Smith repeat the voice more loudly
it be no use
he turn round
a blond-headed silly-faced young man name wilsher whom he barely know be inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table
it be not safe to refuse
after have be recognize he can not go and sit at a table with a unattended girl
it be too noticeable
he sit down with a friendly smile
the silly blond face beam into his
Winston have a hallucination of himself smash a pick-axe right into the middle of it
the girl have table fill up a few minute later
but she must have see him come towards her and perhaps she will take the hint
next day he take care to arrive early
surely enough she be at a table in about the same place and again alone
the person immediately ahead of him in the queue be a small swiftly-moving beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny suspicious eye
as Winston turn away from the counter with his tray he see that the little man be make straight for the girl have table
his hope sink again
there be a vacant place at a table further away but something in the little man have appearance suggest that he will be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the empty table
with ice at his heart Winston follow
it be no use unless he can get the girl alone
at this moment there be a tremendous crash
the little man be sprawl on all four his tray have go fly two stream of soup and coffee be flow across the floor
he start to his foot with a malignant glance at Winston whom he evidently suspect of have trip him up
but it be all right
five second later with a thunder heart Winston be sit at the girl have table
he do not look at her
he unpack his tray and promptly begin eat
it be all-important to speak at once before anyone else come but now a terrible fear have take possession of him
a week have go by since she have first approach him
she will have change her mind she must have change her mind
it be impossible that this affair shall end successfully such thing do not happen in real life
he must have flinch altogether from speak if at this moment he have not see ampleforth the hairy-eared poet wander limply round the room with a tray look for a place to sit down
in his vague way ampleforth be attach to Winston and will certainly sit down at his table if he catch sight of him
there be perhaps a minute in which to act
both Winston and the girl be eat steadily
the stuff they be eat be a thin stew actually a soup of haricot bean
in a low murmur Winston begin speak
neither of them look up steadily they spoon the watery stuff into their mouth and between spoonful exchange the few necessary word in low expressionless voice
what time do you leave work
eighteen-thirty
where can we meet
victory square near the monument
it be full of telescreen
it do+not matter if there be a crowd
any signal
no
do+not come up to me until you see me among a lot of people
and do+not look at me
just keep somewhere near me
what time
nineteen hour
all right
ampleforth fail to see Winston and sit down at another table
they do not speak again and so far as it be possible for two people sit on opposite side of the same table they do not look at one another
the girl finish her lunch quickly and make off while Winston stay to smoke a cigarette
Winston be in victory square before the appoint time
he wander round the base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brother have statue gaze southward towards the sky where he have vanquish the Eurasian aeroplane the eastasian aeroplane it have be a few year ago in the battle of Airstrip one
in the street in front of it there be a statue of a man on horseback which be supposed to represent oliver cromwell
at five minute past the hour the girl have still not appear
again the terrible fear seize upon Winston
she be not come she have change her mind
he walk slowly up to the north side of the square and get a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identify st martin have church whose bell when it have bell have chime you owe me three farthing
then he see the girl stand at the base of the monument read or pretend to read a poster which run spirally up the column
it be not safe to go near her until some more people have accumulate
there be telescreen all round the pediment
but at this moment there be a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicle from somewhere to the left
suddenly everyone seem to be run across the square
the girl nip nimbly round the lion at the base of the monument and join in the rush
Winston follow
as he run he gather from some shout remark that a convoy of Eurasian prisoner be pass
already a dense mass of people be block the south side of the square
Winston at normal time the kind of person who gravitate to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage shove butt squirm his way forward into the heart of the crowd
soon he be within arm have length of the girl but the way be block by a enormous prole and a almost equally enormous woman presumably his wife who seem to form a impenetrable wall of flesh
Winston wriggle himself sideways and with a violent lunge manage to drive his shoulder between them
for a moment it feel as though his entrails be be ground to pulp between the two muscular hip then he have break through sweat a little
he be next to the girl
they be shoulder to shoulder both stare fixedly in front of them
a long line of truck with wooden-faced guard arm with sub-machine gun stand upright in each corner be pass slowly down the street
in the truck little yellow man in shabby greenish uniform be squat jam close together
their sad Mongolian face gaze out over the side of the truck utterly incurious
occasionally when a truck jolt there be a clankclank of metal all the prisoner be wear leg-irons
truckload after truck-load of the sad face pass
Winston know they be there but he see them only intermittently
the girl have shoulder and her arm right down to the elbow be press against his
her cheek be almost near enough for him to feel its warmth
she have immediately take charge of the situation just as she have do in the canteen
she begin speak in the same expressionless voice as before with lip barely move a mere murmur easily drown by the din of voice and the rumble of the truck
can you hear me
yes
can you get Sunday afternoon off
yes
then listen carefully
you will have to remember this
go to Paddington station
with a sort of military precision that astonish him she outline the route that he be to follow
a half-hour railway journey turn left outside the station two kilometre along the road a gate with the top bar miss a path across a field a grass-grown lane a track between bush a dead tree with moss on it
it be as though she have a map inside her head
can you remember all that
she murmur finally
yes
you turn left then right then left again
and the gate have get no top bar
yes
what time
about fifteen
you may have to wait
I will get there by another way
be you sure you remember everything
yes
then get away from me as quick as you can
she need not have tell him that
but for the moment they can not extricate themselves from the crowd
the truck be still file past the people still insatiably gape
at the start there have be a few boo and hiss but it come only from the party member among the crowd and have soon stop
the prevailing emotion be simply curiosity
foreigner whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia be a kind of strange animal
one literally never see them except in the guise of prisoner and even as prisoner one never get more than a momentary glimpse of them
nor do one know what become of them apart from the few who be hang as war-criminal the others simply vanish presumably into forced-labour camp
the round Mongol face have give way to face of a more European type dirty bearded and exhausted
from over scrubby cheekbone eye look into Winston have sometimes with strange intensity and flash away again
the convoy be draw to a end
in the last truck he can see a aged man his face a mass of grizzled hair stand upright with wrist cross in front of him as though he be used to have them bound together
it be almost time for Winston and the girl to part
but at the last moment while the crowd still hem them in her hand feel for his and give it a fleeting squeeze
it can not have be ten second and yet it seem a long time that their hand be clasp together
he have time to learn every detail of her hand
he explore the long finger the shapely nail the work-hardened palm with its row of callouses the smooth flesh under the wrist
merely from feel it he will have know it by sight
in the same instant it occur to him that he do not know what colour the girl have eye be
they be probably brown but people with dark hair sometimes have blue eye
to turn his head and look at her will have be inconceivable folly
with hand lock together invisible among the press of body they stare steadily in front of them and instead of the eye of the girl the eye of the aged prisoner gaze mournfully at Winston out of nest of hair
Winston pick his way up the lane through dapple light and shade step out into pool of gold wherever the bough part
under the tree to the left of him the ground be misty with bluebell
the air seem to kiss one have skin
it be the second of May
from somewhere deep in the heart of the wood come the drone of ring dove
he be a bit early
there have be no difficulty about the journey and the girl be so evidently experienced that he be less frightened than he will normally have be
presumably she can be trust to find a safe place
in general you can not assume that you be much safe in the country than in London
there be no telescreen of course but there be always the danger of concealed microphone by which your voice must be pick up and recognize besides it be not easy to make a journey by yourself without attract attention
for distance of less than 100 kilometre it be not necessary to get your passport endorse but sometimes there be patrol hang about the railway station who examine the paper of any party member they find there and ask awkward question
however no patrol have appear and on the walk from the station he have make sure by cautious backward glance that he be not be follow
the train be full of prole in holiday mood because of the summery weather
the wooden-seated carriage in which he travel be fill to overflow by a single enormous family range from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby go out to spend a afternoon with in-law in the country and as they freely explain to Winston to get hold of a little blackmarket butter
the lane widen and in a minute he come to the footpath she have tell him of a mere cattle-track which plunge between the bush
he have no watch but it can not be fifteen yet
the bluebell be so thick underfoot that it be impossible not to tread on them
he kneel down and begin pick some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he will like to have a bunch of flower to offer to the girl when they meet
he have get together a big bunch and be smell their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back freeze him the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twig
he go on pick bluebell
it be the good thing to do
it must be the girl or he must have be follow after all
to look round be to show guilt
he pick another and another
a hand fall lightly on his shoulder
he look up
it be the girl
she shake her head evidently as a warning that he must keep silent then part the bush and quickly lead the way along the narrow track into the wood
obviously she have be that way before for she dodge the boggy bit as though by habit
Winston follow still clasp his bunch of flower
his first feeling be relief but as he watch the strong slender body move in front of him with the scarlet sash that be just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hip the sense of his own inferiority be heavy upon him
even now it seem quite likely that when she turn round and look at him she will draw back after all
the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaf daunt him
already on the walk from the station the May sunshine have make him feel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sooty dust of London in the pore of his skin
it occur to him that till now she have probably never see him in broad daylight in the open
they come to the fall tree that she have speak of
the girl hop over and force apart the bush in which there do not seem to be a opening
when Winston follow her he find that they be in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knoll surround by tall sapling that shut it in completely
the girl stop and turn
here we be she say
he be face her at several pace have distance
as yet he do not dare move nearer to her
I do+not want to say anything in the lane she go on in case there be a mike hide there
I do+not suppose there be but there can be
there be always the chance of one of those swine recognize your voice
we be all right here
he still have not the courage to approach her
we be all right here
he repeat stupidly
yes
look at the tree
they be small ash which at some time have be cut down and have sprout up again into a forest of pole none of them thick than one have wrist
there be nothing big enough to hide a mike in
besides I have be here before
they be only make conversation
he have manage to move close to her now
she stand before him very upright with a smile on her face that look faintly ironical as though she be wonder why he be so slow to act
the bluebell have cascade on to the ground
they seem to have fall of their own accord
he take her hand
will you believe he say that till this moment I do+not know what colour your eye be
they be brown he note a rather light shade of brown with dark lash
now that you have see what I be really like can you still bear to look at me
yes easily
I be thirty-nine year old
I have get a wife that I can+not get rid of
I have get varicose vein
I have get five false tooth
I could+not care less say the girl
the next moment it be hard to say by whose act she be in his his arm
at the beginning he have no feeling except sheer incredulity
the youthful body be strain against his own the mass of dark hair be against his face and yes actually she have turn her face up and he be kiss the wide red mouth
she have clasp her arm about his neck she be call him darling precious one love one
he have pull her down on to the ground she be utterly unresisting he can do what he like with her
but the truth be that he have no physical sensation except that of mere contact
all he feel be incredulity and pride
he be glad that this be happen but he have no physical desire
it be too soon her youth and prettiness have frighten him he be too much used to live without woman he do not know the reason
the girl pick herself up and pull a bluebell out of her hair
she sit against him put her arm round his waist
never mind dear
there be no hurry
we have get the whole afternoon
be+not this a splendid hide-out
I find it when I get lose once on a community hike
if anyone be come you can hear them a hundred metre away
what be your name
say Winston
julia
I know yours
it be Winston Winston Smith
how do you find that out
I expect I be good at find thing out than you be dear
tell me what do you think of me before that day I give you the note
he do not feel any temptation to tell lie to her
it be even a sort of love-offering to start off by tell the bad
I hate the sight of you he say
I want to rape you and then murder you afterwards
two week ago I think seriously of smash your head in with a cobblestone
if you really want to know I imagine that you have something to do with the thought police
the girl laugh delightedly evidently take this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise
not the thought police
you do+not honestly think that
well perhaps not exactly that
but from your general appearance merely because you be young and fresh and healthy you understand I think that probably
you think I be a good party member
pure in word and deed
banner procession slogan game community hike all that stuff
and you think that if I have a quarter of a chance I will denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you kill off
yes something of that kind
a great many young girl be like that you know
it be this bloody thing that do it she say rip off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex league and fling it on to a bough
then as though touch her waist have remind her of something she feel in the pocket of her overall and produce a small slab of chocolate
she break it in half and give one of the piece to Winston
even before he have take it he know by the smell that it be very unusual chocolate
it be dark and shiny and be wrap in silver paper
chocolate normally be dullbrown crumbly stuff that taste as nearly as one can describe it like the smoke of a rubbish fire
but at some time or another he have taste chocolate like the piece she have give him
the first whiff of its scent have stir up some memory which he can not pin down but which be powerful and trouble
where do you get this stuff
he say
black market she say indifferently
actually I be that sort of girl to look at
I be good at game
I be a troop-leader in the spy
I do voluntary work three evening a week for the Junior Anti-Sex league
hour and hour I have spend paste their bloody rot all over London
I always carry one end of a banner in the procession
I always look cheerful and I never shirk anything
always yell with the crowd that be what I say
it be the only way to be safe
the first fragment of chocolate have melt on Winston have tongue
the taste be delightful
but there be still that memory move round the edge of his consciousness something strongly feel but not reducible to definite shape like a object see out of the corner of one have eye
he push it away from him aware only that it be the memory of some action which he will have like to undo but can not
you be very young he say
you be ten or fifteen year young than I be
what can you see to attract you in a man like me
it be something in your face
I think I will take a chance
I be good at spot people who do+not belong
as soon as I see you I know you be against them
them it appear mean the party and above all the inner party about whom she talk with a open jeer hatred which make Winston feel uneasy although he know that they be safe here if they can be safe anywhere
a thing that astonish him about her be the coarseness of her language
party member be supposed not to swear and Winston himself very seldom do swear aloud at any rate
julia however seem unable to mention the party and especially the inner party without use the kind of word that you see chalk up in dripping alley-way
he do not dislike it
it be merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its way and somehow it seem natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smell bad hay
they have leave the clearing and be wander again through the chequered shade with their arm round each other have waist whenever it be wide enough to walk two abreast
he notice how much soft her waist seem to feel now that the sash be go
they do not speak above a whisper
outside the clearing julia say it be good to go quietly
presently they have reach the edge of the little wood
she stop him
do+not go out into the open
there must be someone watch
we be all right if we keep behind the bough
they be stand in the shade of hazel bush
the sunlight filter through innumerable leaf be still hot on their face
Winston look out into the field beyond and undergo a curious slow shock of recognition
he know it by sight
a old closebitten pasture with a footpath wander across it and a molehill here and there
in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the bough of the elm tree sway just perceptibly in the breeze and their leaf stir faintly in dense mass like woman have hair
surely somewhere nearby but out of sight there must be a stream with green pool where dace be swim
be+not there a stream somewhere near here
he whisper
that be right there be a stream
it be at the edge of the next field actually
there be fish in it great big one
you can watch them lie in the pool under the willow tree wave their tail
it be the golden country almost he murmur
the golden country
it be nothing really
a landscape I have see sometimes in a dream
look whisper julia
a thrush have alight on a bough not five metre away almost at the level of their face
perhaps it have not see them
it be in the sun they in the shade
it spread out its wing fit them carefully into place again duck its head for a moment as though make a sort of obeisance to the sun and then begin to pour forth a torrent of song
in the afternoon hush the volume of sound be startling
Winston and julia cling together fascinate
the music go on and on minute after minute with astonishing variation never once repeat itself almost as though the bird be deliberately show off its virtuosity
sometimes it stop for a few second spread out and resettle its wing then swell its speckled breast and again burst into song
Winston watch it with a sort of vague reverence
for whom for what be that bird sing
no mate no rival be watch it
what make it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness
he wonder whether after all there be a microphone hide somewhere near
he and julia have speak only in low whisper and it will not pick up what they have say but it will pick up the thrush
perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetle-like man be listen intently listen to that
but by degree the flood of music drive all speculation out of his mind
it be as though it be a kind of liquid stuff that pour all over him and get mix up with the sunlight that filter through the leaf
he stop think and merely feel
the girl have waist in the bend of his arm be soft and warm
he pull her round so that they be breast to breast her body seem to melt into his
wherever his hand move it be all as yielding as water
their mouth cling together it be quite different from the hard kiss they have exchange early
when they move their face apart again both of them sigh deeply
the bird take fright and flee with a clatter of wing
Winston put his lip against her ear
now he whisper
not here she whisper back
come back to the hide-out
it be safe
quickly with a occasional crackle of twig they thread their way back to the clearing
when they be once inside the ring of sapling she turn and face him
they be both breathe fast but the smile have reappear round the corner of her mouth
she stand look at him for a instant then feel at the zipper of her overall
and yes it be almost as in his dream
almost as swiftly as he have imagine it she have torn her clothes off and when she fling them aside it be with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seem to be annihilate
her body gleam white in the sun
but for a moment he do not look at her body his eye be anchor by the freckled face with its faint bold smile
he kneel down before her and take her hand in his
have you do this before
of course
hundred of time well score of time anyway
with party member
yes always with party member
with member of the inner party
not with those swine no
but there be plenty that will if they get half a chance
they be not so holy as they make out
his heart leap
score of time she have do it he wish it have be hundred thousand
anything that hint at corruption always fill him with a wild hope
who know perhaps the party be rotten under the surface its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham conceal iniquity
if he can have infect the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly he will have do so
anything to rot to weaken to undermine
he pull her down so that they be kneel face to face
listen
the more man you have have the more I love you
do you understand that
yes perfectly
I hate purity I hate goodness
I do+not want any virtue to exist anywhere
I want everyone to be corrupt to the bone
well then I ought to suit you dear
I be corrupt to the bone
you like do this
I do+not mean simply me I mean the thing in itself
I adore it
that be above all what he want to hear
not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire that be the force that will tear the party to piece
he press her down upon the grass among the fall bluebell
this time there be no difficulty
presently the rise and fall of their breast slow to normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fall apart
the sun seem to have grow hot
they be both sleepy
he reach out for the discard overall and pull them partly over her
almost immediately they fall asleep and sleep for about half a hour
Winston wake first
he sit up and watch the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillow on the palm of her hand
except for her mouth you can not call her beautiful
there be a line or two round the eye if you look closely
the short dark hair be extraordinarily thick and soft
it occur to him that he still do not know her surname or where she live
the young strong body now helpless in sleep awake in him a pitying protect feeling
but the mindless tenderness that he have feel under the hazel tree while the thrush be sing have not quite come back
he pull the overall aside and study her smooth white flank
in the old day he think a man look at a girl have body and see that it be desirable and that be the end of the story
but you can not have pure love or pure lust nowadays
no emotion be pure because everything be mix up with fear and hatred
their embrace have be a battle the climax a victory
it be a blow strike against the party
it be a political act
we can come here once again say julia
it be generally safe to use any hide-out twice
but not for another month or two of course
as soon as she wake up her demeanour have change
she become alert and business-like put her clothes on knot the scarlet sash about her waist and begin arrange the detail of the journey home
it seem natural to leave this to her
she obviously have a practical cunning which Winston lack and she seem also to have a exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London store away from innumerable community hike
the route she give him be quite different from the one by which he have come and bring him out at a different railway station
never go home the same way as you go out she say as though enunciate a important general principle
she will leave first and Winston be to wait half a hour before follow her
she have name a place where they can meet after work four evening hence
it be a street in one of the poor quarter where there be a open market which be generally crowded and noisy
she will be hang about among the stall pretend to be in search of shoelace or sewing-thread
if she judge that the coast be clear she will blow her nose when he approach otherwise he be to walk past her without recognition
but with luck in the middle of the crowd it will be safe to talk for a quarter of a hour and arrange another meeting
and now I must go she say as soon as he have master his instruction
I be due back at nineteen-thirty
I have get to put in two hour for the Junior Anti-Sex league hand out leaflet or something
be+not it bloody
give me a brush-down will you
have I get any twig in my hair
be you sure
then good-bye my love good-bye
she fling herself into his arm kiss him almost violently and a moment later push her way through the sapling and disappear into the wood with very little noise
even now he have not find out her surname or her address
however it make no difference for it be inconceivable that they can ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of write communication
as it happen they never go back to the clearing in the wood
during the month of May there be only one further occasion on which they actually succeed in make love
that be in another hiding-place know to julia the belfry of a ruinous church in a almost-deserted stretch of country where a atomic bomb have fall thirty year early
it be a good hiding-place when once you get there but the get there be very dangerous
for the rest they can meet only in the street in a different place every evening and never for more than half a hour at a time
in the street it be usually possible to talk after a fashion
as they drift down the crowded pavement not quite abreast and never look at one another they carry on a curious intermittent conversation which flick on and off like the beam of a lighthouse suddenly nip into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then take up again minute later in the middle of a sentence then abruptly cut short as they part at the agreed spot then continue almost without introduction on the following day
julia appear to be quite used to this kind of conversation which she call talk by instalment
she be also surprisingly adept at speak without move her lip
just once in almost a month of nightly meeting they manage to exchange a kiss
they be pass in silence down a side-street julia will never speak when they be away from the main street when there be a deafening roar the earth heave and the air darken and Winston find himself lie on his side bruise and terrify
a rocket bomb must have drop quite near at hand
suddenly he become aware of julia have face a few centimetre from his own deathly white as white as chalk
even her lip be white
she be dead
he clasp her against him and found that he be kiss a live warm face
but there be some powdery stuff that get in the way of his lip
both of their face be thickly coat with plaster
there be evening when they reach their rendezvous and then have to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol have just come round the corner or a helicopter be hover overhead
even if it have be less dangerous it will still have be difficult to find time to meet
Winston have working week be sixty hour julia have be even long and their free day vary accord to the pressure of work and do not often coincide
julia in any case seldom have a evening completely free
she spend a astonishing amount of time in attend lecture and demonstration distribute literature for the Junior Anti-Sex league prepare banner for hate week make collection for the saving campaign and such-like activity
it pay she say it be camouflage
if you keep the small rule you can break the big one
she even induce Winston to mortgage yet another of his evening by enrol himself for the part-time munition work which be do voluntarily by zealous party member
so one evening every week Winston spend four hour of paralyse boredom screw together small bit of metal which be probably part of bomb fuse in a draughty ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammer mingle drearily with the music of the telescreen
when they meet in the church tower the gap in their fragmentary conversation be fill up
it be a blazing afternoon
the air in the little square chamber above the bell be hot and stagnant and smell overpoweringly of pigeon dung
they sit talk for hour on the dusty twig-littered floor one or other of them get up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one be come
julia be twenty-six year old
she live in a hostel with thirty other girl always in the stink of woman
how I hate woman she say parenthetical and she work as he have guess on the novel-writing machine in the fiction department
she enjoy her work which consist chiefly in run and service a powerful but tricky electric motor
she be not clever but be fond of use her hand and feel at home with machinery
she can describe the whole process of compose a novel from the general directive issue by the planning committee down to the final touching-up by the rewrite squad
but she be not interested in the finish product
she do+not much care for read she say
book be just a commodity that have to be produce like jam or bootlace
she have no memory of anything before the early sixties and the only person she have ever know who talk frequently of the day before the revolution be a grandfather who have disappear when she be eight
at school she have be captain of the hockey team and have win the gymnastics trophy two year running
she have be a troop-leader in the spy and a branch secretary in the youth league before join the Junior Anti-Sex league
she have always bear a excellent character
she have even a infallible mark of good reputation be pick out to work in pornosec the sub-section of the fiction department which turn out cheap pornography for distribution among the prole
it be nickname muck house by the people who work in it she remark
there she have remain for a year help to produce booklet in seal packet with title like spanking story or one night in a girl have school to be buy furtively by proletarian youth who be under the impression that they be buy something illegal
what be these book like
say Winston curiously
oh ghastly rubbish
they be boring really
they only have six plot but they swap them round a bit
of course I be only on the kaleidoscope
I be never in the rewrite squad
I be not literary dear not even enough for that
he learn with astonishment that all the worker in pornosec except the head of the department be girl
the theory be that man whose sex instinct be less controllable than those of woman be in great danger of be corrupt by the filth they handle
they do+not even like have married woman there she add
girl be always supposed to be so pure
here be one who be+not anyway
she have have her first love-affair when she be sixteen with a party member of sixty who later commit suicide to avoid arrest
and a good job too say julia otherwise they will have have my name out of him when he confess
since then there have be various others
life as she see it be quite simple
you want a good time they mean the party want to stop you have it you break the rule as best you can
she seem to think it just as natural that they shall want to rob you of your pleasure as that you shall want to avoid be catch
she hate the party and say so in the crude word but she make no general criticism of it
except where it touch upon her own life she have no interest in party doctrine
he notice that she never use Newspeak word except the one that have pass into everyday use
she have never hear of the brotherhood and refuse to believe in its existence
any kind of organized revolt against the party which be bound to be a failure strike her as stupid
the clever thing be to break the rule and stay alive all the same
he wonder vague how many others like her there must be in the young generation people who have grown up in the world of the revolution know nothing else accept the party as something unalterable like the sky not rebel against its authority but simply evade it as a rabbit dodge a dog
they do not discuss the possibility of get marry
it be too remote to be worth think about
no imaginable committee will ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine Winston have wife can somehow have be get rid of
it be hopeless even as a daydream
what be she like your wife
say julia
she be do you know the Newspeak word goodthinkful
mean naturally orthodox incapable of think a bad thought
no I do+not know the word but I know the kind of person right enough
he begin tell her the story of his married life but curiously enough she appear to know the essential part of it already
she describe to him almost as though she have see or feel it the stiffen of katharine have body as soon as he touch her the way in which she still seem to be push him from her with all her strength even when her arm be clasp tightly round him
with julia he feel no difficulty in talk about such thing katharine in any case have long cease to be a painful memory and become merely a distasteful one
I can have stand it if it have+not be for one thing he say
he tell her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine have force him to go through on the same night every week
she hate it but nothing will make her stop do it
she use to call it but you will never guess
our duty to the party say julia promptly
how do you know that
I have be at school too dear
sex talk once a month for the over-sixteens
and in the youth movement
they rub it into you for year
I dare say it work in a lot of case
but of course you can never tell people be such hypocrite
she begin to enlarge upon the subject
with julia everything come back to her own sexuality
as soon as this be touch upon in any way she be capable of great acuteness
unlike Winston she have grasp the inner meaning of the party have sexual puritanism
it be not merely that the sex instinct create a world of its own which be outside the party have control and which therefore have to be destroy if possible
what be more important be that sexual privation induce hysteria which be desirable because it can be transform into war-fever and leader-worship
the way she put it be
when you make love you be use up energy and afterwards you feel happy and do+not give a damn for anything
they can+not bear you to feel like that
they want you to be burst with energy all the time
all this march up and down and cheer and wave flag be simply sex go sour
if you be happy inside yourself why shall you get excite about big brother and the Three-Year plan and the two minute hate and all the rest of their bloody rot
that be very true he think
there be a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy
for how can the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulity which the party need in its member be keep at the right pitch except by bottle down some powerful instinct and use it as a driving force
the sex impulse be dangerous to the party and the party have turn it to account
they have play a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood
the family can not actually be abolish and indeed people be encourage to be fond of their child in almost the old-fashioned way
the child on the other hand be systematically turn against their parent and teach to spy on them and report their deviation
the family have become in effect a extension of the thought police
it be a device by means of which everyone can be surround night and day by informer who know him intimately
abruptly his mind go back to katharine
katharine will unquestionably have denounce him to the thought police if she have not happen to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinion
but what really recall her to him at this moment be the stifling heat of the afternoon which have bring the sweat out on his forehead
he begin tell julia of something that have happen or rather have fail to happen on another sweltering summer afternoon eleven year ago
it be three or four month after they be marry
they have lose their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent
they have only lag behind the others for a couple of minute but they take a wrong turning and presently find themselves pull up short by the edge of a old chalk quarry
it be a sheer drop of ten or twenty metre with boulder at the bottom
there be nobody of whom they can ask the way
as soon as she realize that they be lost katharine become very uneasy
to be away from the noisy mob of hiker even for a moment give her a feeling of wrong-doing
she want to hurry back by the way they have come and start search in the other direction
but at this moment Winston notice some tuft of loosestrife grow in the crack of the cliff beneath them
one tuft be of two colour magenta and brick-red apparently grow on the same root
he have never see anything of the kind before and he call to katharine to come and look at it
look katharine
look at those flower
that clump down near the bottom
do you see they be two different colour
she have already turn to go but she do rather fretful come back for a moment
she even lean out over the cliff face to see where he be point
he be stand a little behind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady her
at this moment it suddenly occur to him how completely alone they be
there be not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stir not even a bird awake
in a place like this the danger that there will be a hide microphone be very small and even if there be a microphone it will only pick up sound
it be the hot sleepy hour of the afternoon
the sun blaze down upon them the sweat tickle his face
and the thought strike him
why do+not you give her a good shove
say julia
I will have
yes dear you will have
I will if I have be the same person then as I be now
or perhaps I will I be not certain
be you sorry you do+not
yes
on the whole I be sorry I do+not
they be sit side by side on the dusty floor
he pull her close against him
her head rest on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquer the pigeon dung
she be very young he think she still expect something from life she do not understand that to push a inconvenient person over a cliff solve nothing
actually it will have make no difference he say
then why be you sorry you do+not do it
only because I prefer a positive to a negative
in this game that we be play we can+not win
some kind of failure be good than other kind that be all
he feel her shoulder give a wriggle of dissent
she always contradict him when he say anything of this kind
she will not accept it as a law of nature that the individual be always defeat
in a way she realize that she herself be doom that sooner or later the thought police will catch her and kill her but with another part of her mind she believe that it be somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you can live as you choose
all you need be luck and cunning and boldness
she do not understand that there be no such thing as happiness that the only victory lie in the far future long after you be dead that from the moment of declare war on the party it be good to think of yourself as a corpse
we be the dead he say
we be not dead yet say julia prosaically
not physically
six month a year five year conceivably
I be afraid of death
you be young so presumably you be more afraid of it than I be
obviously we shall put it off as long as we can
but it make very little difference
so long as human being stay human death and life be the same thing
oh rubbish
which will you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton
do+not you enjoy be alive
do+not you like feel this be me this be my hand this be my leg I be real I be solid I be alive
do+not you like this
she twist herself round and press her bosom against him
he can feel her breast ripe yet firm through her overall
her body seem to be pour some of its youth and vigour into his
yes I like that he say
then stop talk about die
and now listen dear we have get to fix up about the next time we meet
we may as well go back to the place in the wood
we have give it a good long rest
but you must get there by a different way this time
I have get it all plan out
you take the train but look I will draw it out for you
and in her practical way she scrape together a small square of dust and with a twig from a pigeon have nest begin draw a map on the floor
Winston look round the shabby little room above Mister charrington have shop
beside the window the enormous bed be make up with ragged blanket and a coverless bolster
the old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face be tick away on the mantelpiece
in the corner on the gateleg table the glass paperweight which he have buy on his last visit gleam softly out of the half-darkness
in the fender be a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cup provide by Mister charrington
Winston light the burner and set a pan of water to boil
he have bring a envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablet
the clock have hand say seventeen-twenty it be nineteen-twenty really
she be come at nineteen-thirty
folly folly his heart keep say conscious gratuitous suicidal folly
of all the crime that a party member can commit this one be the least possible to conceal
actually the idea have first float into his head in the form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirror by the surface of the gateleg table
as he have foresee Mister charrington have make no difficulty about let the room
he be obviously glad of the few dollar that it will bring him
nor do he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it be make clear that Winston want the room for the purpose of a love-affair
instead he look into the middle distance and speak in generality with so delicate a air as to give the impression that he have become partly invisible
privacy he say be a very valuable thing
everyone want a place where they can be alone occasionally
and when they have such a place it be only common courtesy in anyone else who know of it to keep his knowledge to himself
he even seem almost to fade out of existence as he do so add that there be two entry to the house one of them through the back yard which give on a alley
under the window somebody be sing
Winston peep out secure in the protection of the muslin curtain
the June sun be still high in the sky and in the sun-filled court below a monstrous woman solid as a Norman pillar with brawny red forearm and a sack apron strap about her middle be stump to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line peg out a series of square white thing which Winston recognize as baby have diaper
whenever her mouth be not corked with clothes peg she be sing in a powerful contralto
it be only a hopeless fancy
it pass like a Ipril dye
but a look and a word and the dream they stir
they have steal my heart awye
the tune have be haunt London for week past
it be one of countless similar song publish for the benefit of the prole by a sub-section of the music department
the word of these song be compose without any human intervention whatever on a instrument know as a versificator
but the woman sing so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into a almost pleasant sound
he can hear the woman sing and the scrape of her shoe on the flagstone and the cry of the child in the street and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet the room seem curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreen
folly folly folly he think again
it be inconceivable that they can frequent this place for more than a few week without be catch
but the temptation of have a hiding-place that be truly their own indoors and near at hand have be too much for both of them
for some time after their visit to the church belfry it have be impossible to arrange meeting
working hour have be drastically increase in anticipation of hate week
it be more than a month distant but the enormous complex preparation that it entail be throw extra work on to everybody
finally both of them manage to secure a free afternoon on the same day
they have agree to go back to the clearing in the wood
on the evening beforehand they meet briefly in the street
as usual Winston hardly look at julia as they drift towards one another in the crowd but from the short glance he give her it seem to him that she be pale than usual
it be all off she murmur as soon as she judge it safe to speak
tomorrow I mean
what
tomorrow afternoon
I can+not come
why not
oh the usual reason
it have start early this time
for a moment he be violently angry
during the month that he have know her the nature of his desire for her have change
at the beginning there have be little true sensuality in it
their first love-making have be simply a act of the will
but after the second time it be different
the smell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seem to have get inside him or into the air all round him
she have become a physical necessity something that he not only want but feel that he have a right to
when she say that she can not come he have the feeling that she be cheat him
but just at this moment the crowd press them together and their hand accidentally meet
she give the tip of his finger a quick squeeze that seem to invite not desire but affection
it strike him that when one live with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such as he have not feel for her before suddenly take hold of him
he wish that they be a married couple of ten year have standing
he wish that he be walk through the street with her just as they be do now but openly and without fear talk of triviality and buy odds and end for the household
he wish above all that they have some place where they can be alone together without feel the obligation to make love every time they meet
it be not actually at that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of rent Mister charrington have room have occur to him
when he suggest it to julia she have agree with unexpected readiness
both of them know that it be lunacy
it be as though they be intentionally step nearer to their grave
as he sit wait on the edge of the bed he think again of the cellar of the ministry of love
it be curious how that predestined horror move in and out of one have consciousness
there it lie fix in future time precede death as surely as 99 precede 100
one can not avoid it but one can perhaps postpone it and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one choose to shorten the interval before it happen
at this moment there be a quick step on the stair
julia burst into the room
she be carry a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas such as he have sometimes see her carry to and fro at the ministry
he start forward to take her in his arm but she disengage herself rather hurriedly partly because she be still hold the tool-bag
half a second she say
just let me show you what I have bring
do you bring some of that filthy victory coffee
I think you will
you can chuck it away again because we shall+not be need it
look here
she fall on her knee throw open the bag and tumble out some spanner and a screwdriver that fill the top part of it
underneath be a number of neat paper packet
the first packet that she pass to Winston have a strange and yet vague familiar feeling
it be fill with some kind of heavy sand-like stuff which yield wherever you touch it
it be+not sugar
he say
real sugar
not saccharine sugar
and here be a loaf of bread proper white bread not our bloody stuff and a little pot of jam
and here be a tin of milk but look
this be the one I be really proud of
I have to wrap a bit of sacking round it because
but she do not need to tell him why she have wrap it up
the smell be already fill the room a rich hot smell which seem like a emanation from his early childhood but which one do occasionally meet with even now blow down a passage-way before a door slam or diffuse itself mysteriously in a crowded street sniff for a instant and then lose again
it be coffee he murmur real coffee
it be inner party coffee
there be a whole kilo here she say
how do you manage to get hold of all these thing
it be all inner party stuff
there be nothing those swine do+not have nothing
but of course waiter and servant and people pinch thing and look I get a little packet of tea as well
Winston have squat down beside her
he tear open a corner of the packet
it be real tea
not blackberry leaf
there have be a lot of tea about lately
they have capture India or something she say vague
but listen dear
I want you to turn your back on me for three minute
go and sit on the other side of the bed
do+not go too near the window
and do+not turn round till I tell you
Winston gaze abstractedly through the muslin curtain
down in the yard the red-armed woman be still march to and fro between the washtub and the line
she take two more peg out of her mouth and sing with deep feeling
they sye that time heal all thing
they sye you can always forget
but the smile and the tear acrorss the year
they twist my heart-string yet
she know the whole drivel song by heart it seem
her voice float upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charge with a sort of happy melancholy
one have the feeling that she will have be perfectly content if the June evening have be endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand year peg out diaper and sing rubbish
it strike him as a curious fact that he have never hear a member of the party sing alone and spontaneously
it will even have seem slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talk to oneself
perhaps it be only when people be somewhere near the starvation level that they have anything to sing about
you can turn round now say julia
he turn round and for a second almost fail to recognize her
what he have actually expect be to see her naked
but she be not naked
the transformation that have happen be much more surprising than that
she have paint her face
she must have slip into some shop in the proletarian quarter and buy herself a complete set of make-up material
her lip be deeply redden her cheek rouge her nose powder there be even a touch of something under the eye to make them bright
it be not very skilfully do but Winston have standard in such matter be not high
he have never before see or imagine a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face
the improvement in her appearance be startling
with just a few dab of colour in the right place she have become not only very much pretty but above all far more feminine
her short hair and boyish overall merely add to the effect
as he take her in his arm a wave of synthetic violet flood his nostril
he remember the half-darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman have cavernous mouth
it be the very same scent that she have use but at the moment it do not seem to matter
scent too he say
yes dear scent too
and do you know what I be go to do next
I be go to get hold of a real woman have frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers
I will wear silk stocking and high-heeled shoe
in this room I be go to be a woman not a party comrade
they fling their clothes off and climb into the huge mahogany bed
it be the first time that he have strip himself naked in her presence
until now he have be too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose vein stand out on his calf and the discoloured patch over his ankle
there be no sheet but the blanket they lie on be threadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonish both of them
it be sure to be full of bug but who care
say julia
one never see a double bed nowadays except in the home of the prole
Winston have occasionally sleep in one in his boyhood julia have never be in one before so far as she can remember
presently they fall asleep for a little while
when Winston wake up the hand of the clock have crept round to nearly nine
he do not stir because julia be sleep with her head in the crook of his arm
most of her make-up have transfer itself to his own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still bring out the beauty of her cheekbone
a yellow ray from the sink sun fall across the foot of the bed and light up the fireplace where the water in the pan be boil fast
down in the yard the woman have stop sing but the faint shout of child float in from the street
he wonder vague whether in the abolish past it have be a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on make love when they choose talk of what they choose not feel any compulsion to get up simply lie there and listen to peaceful sound outside
surely there can never have be a time when that seem ordinary
julia wake up rub her eye and raise herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove
half that water have boil away she say
I will get up and make some coffee in another moment
we have get a hour
what time do they cut the light off at your flat
twenty-three thirty
it be twenty-three at the hostel
but you have to get in early than that because hi
get out you filthy brute
she suddenly twist herself over in the bed seize a shoe from the floor and sent it hurtle into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactly as he have see her fling the dictionary at Goldstein that morning during the two minute hate
what be it
he say in surprise
a rat
I see him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting
there be a hole down there
I give him a good fright anyway
rat murmur Winston
in this room
they be all over the place say julia indifferently as she lie down again
we have even get them in the kitchen at the hostel
some part of London be swarm with them
do you know they attack child
yes they do
in some of these street a woman dare+not leave a baby alone for two minute
it be the great huge brown one that do it
and the nasty thing be that the brute always
do+not go on say Winston with his eye tightly shut
dear
you have go quite pale
what be the matter
do they make you feel sick
of all horror in the world a rat
she press herself against him and wound her limb round him as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body
he do not reopen his eye immediately
for several moment he have have the feeling of be back in a nightmare which have recur from time to time throughout his life
it be always very much the same
he be stand in front of a wall of darkness and on the other side of it there be something unendurable something too dreadful to be face
in the dream his deep feeling be always one of self-deception because he do in fact know what be behind the wall of darkness
with a deadly effort like wrench a piece out of his own brain he can even have drag the thing into the open
he always wake up without discover what it be but somehow it be connect with what julia have be say when he cut her short
I be sorry he say it be nothing
I do+not like rat that be all
do+not worry dear we be not go to have the filthy brute in here
I will stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go
and next time we come here I will bring some plaster and bung it up properly
already the black instant of panic be half-forgotten
feel slightly ashamed of himself he sit up against the bedhead
julia get out of bed pull on her overall and make the coffee
the smell that rise from the saucepan be so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside shall notice it and become inquisitive
what be even good than the taste of the coffee be the silky texture give to it by the sugar a thing Winston have almost forget after year of saccharine
with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wander about the room glance indifferently at the bookcase point out the good way of repair the gateleg table plump herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it be comfortable and examine the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement
she bring the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a good light
he take it out of her hand fascinate as always by the soft rainwatery appearance of the glass
what be it do you think
say julia
I do+not think it be anything I mean I do+not think it be ever put to any use
that be what I like about it
it be a little chunk of history that they have forget to alter
it be a message from a hundred year ago if one know how to read it
and that picture over there she nod at the engraving on the opposite wall will that be a hundred year old
more
two hundred I dare say
one can+not tell
it be impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays
she go over to look at it
here be where that brute stuck his nose out she say kick the wainscoting immediately below the picture
what be this place
I have see it before somewhere
it be a church or at least it use to be
st clement Dane its name be
the fragment of rhyme that Mister charrington have teach him come back into his head and he add half-nostalgically orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
to his astonishment she cap the line
you owe me three farthing say the bell of st martin have
when will you pay me say the bell of old bailey
I can+not remember how it go on after that
but anyway I remember it end up here come a candle to light you to bed here come a chopper to chop off your head
it be like the two half of a countersign
but there must be another line after the bell of old bailey
perhaps it can be dug out of Mister charrington have memory if he be suitably prompt
who teach you that
he say
my grandfather
he use to say it to me when I be a little girl
he be vaporize when I be eight at any rate he disappear
I wonder what a lemon be she add inconsequently
I have see orange
they be a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin
I can remember lemon say Winston
they be quite common in the fifty
they be so sour that it set your tooth on edge even to smell them
I bet that picture have get bug behind it say julia
I will take it down and give it a good clean some day
I suppose it be almost time we be leave
I must start wash this paint off
what a bore
I will get the lipstick off your face afterwards
Winston do not get up for a few minute more
the room be darken
he turn over towards the light and lie gaze into the glass paperweight
the inexhaustibly interesting thing be not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself
there be such a depth of it and yet it be almost as transparent as air
it be as though the surface of the glass have be the arch of the sky enclose a tiny world with its atmosphere complete
he have the feeling that he can get inside it and that in fact he be inside it along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself
the paperweight be the room he be in and the coral be julia have life and his own fix in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal
Syme have vanish
a morning come and he be miss from work a few thoughtless people comment on his absence
on the next day nobody mention him
on the third day Winston go into the vestibule of the record department to look at the notice-board
one of the notice carry a printed list of the member of the chess committee of whom Syme have be one
it look almost exactly as it have look before nothing have be cross out but it be one name short
it be enough
Syme have cease to exist he have never exist
the weather be bake hot
in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless air-conditioned room keep their normal temperature but outside the pavement scorch one have foot and the stench of the tube at the rush hour be a horror
the preparation for hate week be in full swing and the staff of all the Ministries be work overtime
procession meeting military parade lecture waxwork display film show telescreen programme all have to be organize stand have to be erect effigy build slogan coin song write rumour circulate photograph fake
julia have unit in the fiction department have be take off the production of novel and be rush out a series of atrocity pamphlet
Winston in addition to his regular work spend long period every day in go through back file of the Times and alter and embellish news item which be to be quote in speech
late at night when crowd of rowdy prole roam the street the town have a curiously febrile air
the rocket bomb crash often than ever and sometimes in the far distance there be enormous explosion which no one can explain and about which there be wild rumour
the new tune which be to be the theme-song of hate week the hate song it be call have already be compose and be be endlessly plug on the telescreen
it have a savage bark rhythm which can not exactly be call music but resemble the beating of a drum
roar out by hundred of voice to the tramp of march foot it be terrifying
the prole have take a fancy to it and in the midnight street it compete with the still-popular it be only a hopeless fancy
the Parsons child play it at all hour of the night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper
Winston have evening be full than ever
squad of volunteer organize by Parsons be prepare the street for hate week stitch banner paint poster erect flagstaff on the roof and perilously sling wire across the street for the reception of streamer
Parsons boast that victory mansion alone will display four hundred metre of bunting
he be in his native element and as happy as a lark
the heat and the manual work have even give him a pretext for revert to short and a open shirt in the evening
he be everywhere at once push pull saw hammer improvise jolly everyone along with comradely exhortation and give out from every fold of his body what seem a inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat
a new poster have suddenly appear all over London
it have no caption and represent simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier three or four metre high stride forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boot a submachine gun point from his hip
from whatever angle you look at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnify by the foreshorten seem to be point straight at you
the thing have be plaster on every blank space on every wall even outnumber the portrait of big brother
the prole normally apathetic about the war be be lash into one of their periodical frenzy of patriotism
as though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bomb have be kill large number of people than usual
one fall on a crowded film theatre in stepney bury several hundred victim among the ruin
the whole population of the neighbourhood turn out for a long trail funeral which go on for hour and be in effect a indignation meeting
another bomb fall on a piece of waste ground which be use as a playground and several dozen child be blow to piece
there be further angry demonstration Goldstein be burn in effigy hundred of copy of the poster of the Eurasian soldier be tear down and add to the flame and a number of shop be loot in the turmoil then a rumour fly round that spy be direct the rocket bomb by means of wireless wave and a old couple who be suspect of be of foreign extraction have their house set on fire and perish of suffocation
in the room over Mister charrington have shop when they can get there julia and Winston lie side by side on a strip bed under the open window naked for the sake of coolness
the rat have never come back but the bug have multiply hideously in the heat
it do not seem to matter
dirty or clean the room be paradise
as soon as they arrive they will sprinkle everything with pepper buy on the black market tear off their clothes and make love with sweat body then fall asleep and wake to find that the bug have rally and be mass for the counter-attack
four five six seven time they meet during the month of June
Winston have drop his habit of drink gin at all hour
he seem to have lose the need for it
he have grow fat his varicose ulcer have subside leave only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fit of cough in the early morning have stop
the process of life have cease to be intolerable he have no longer any impulse to make face at the telescreen or shout curse at the top of his voice
now that they have a secure hiding-place almost a home it do not even seem a hardship that they can only meet infrequently and for a couple of hour at a time
what matter be that the room over the junk-shop shall exist
to know that it be there inviolate be almost the same as be in it
the room be a world a pocket of the past where extinct animal can walk
Mister charrington think Winston be another extinct animal
he usually stop to talk with Mister charrington for a few minute on his way upstairs
the old man seem seldom or never to go out of door and on the other hand to have almost no customer
he lead a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop and a even tiny back kitchen where he prepare his meal and which contain among other thing a unbelievably ancient gramophone with a enormous horn
he seem glad of the opportunity to talk
wander about among his worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectacle and his bowed shoulder in the velvet jacket he have always vague the air of be a collector rather than a tradesman
with a sort of fadeed enthusiasm he will finger this scrap of rubbish or that a china bottle-stopper the paint lid of a broken snuffbox a pinchbeck locket contain a strand of some long-dead baby have hair never ask that Winston shall buy it merely that he shall admire it
to talk to him be like listen to the tinkle of a worn-out musical-box
he have drag out from the corner of his memory some more fragment of forget rhyme
there be one about four and twenty blackbird and another about a cow with a crumpled horn and another about the death of poor cock robin
it just occur to me you must be interested he will say with a deprecate little laugh whenever he produce a new fragment
but he can never recall more than a few line of any one rhyme
both of them know in a way it be never out of their mind that what be now happen can not last long
there be time when the fact of impending death seem as palpable as the bed they lie on and they will cling together with a sort of despair sensuality like a damned soul grasp at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock be within five minute of strike
but there be also time when they have the illusion not only of safety but of permanence
so long as they be actually in this room they both feel no harm can come to them
get there be difficult and dangerous but the room itself be sanctuary
it be as when Winston have gaze into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling that it will be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once inside it time can be arrest
often they give themselves up to daydream of escape
their luck will hold indefinitely and they will carry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder of their natural life
or katharine will die and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and julia will succeed in get marry
or they will commit suicide together
or they will disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn to speak with proletarian accent get job in a factory and live out their life undetected in a back-street
it be all nonsense as they both know
in reality there be no escape
even the one plan that be practicable suicide they have no intention of carry out
to hang on from day to day and from week to week spin out a present that have no future seem a unconquerable instinct just as one have lung will always draw the next breath so long as there be air available
sometimes too they talk of engage in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to take the first step
even if the fabulous brotherhood be a reality there still remain the difficulty of find one have way into it
he tell her of the strange intimacy that exist or seem to exist between himself and O'Brien and of the impulse he sometimes feel simply to walk into O'Brien have presence announce that he be the enemy of the party and demand his help
curiously enough this do not strike her as a impossibly rash thing to do
she be used to judge people by their face and it seem natural to her that Winston shall believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eye
moreover she take it for grant that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hate the party and will break the rule if he think it safe to do so
but she refuse to believe that widespread organized opposition exist or can exist
the tale about Goldstein and his underground army she say be simply a lot of rubbish which the party have invent for its own purpose and which you have to pretend to believe in
time beyond number at party rally and spontaneous demonstration she have shout at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose name she have never hear and in whose supposed crime she have not the faint belief
when public trial be happen she have take her place in the detachment from the youth league who surround the court from morning to night chant at interval death to the traitor
during the two minute hate she always excel all others in shout insult at Goldstein
yet she have only the dim idea of who Goldstein be and what doctrine he be supposed to represent
she have grown up since the revolution and be too young to remember the ideological battle of the fifty and sixties
such a thing as a independent political movement be outside her imagination and in any case the party be invincible
it will always exist and it will always be the same
you can only rebel against it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated act of violence such as kill somebody or blow something up
in some way she be far more acute than Winston and far less susceptible to party propaganda
once when he happen in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia she startle him by say casually that in her opinion the war be not happen
the rocket bomb which fall daily on London be probably fire by the government of Oceania itself just to keep people frightened
this be a idea that have literally never occur to him
she also stir a sort of envy in him by tell him that during the two minute hate her great difficulty be to avoid burst out laugh
but she only question the teaching of the party when they in some way touch upon her own life
often she be ready to accept the official mythology simply because the difference between truth and falsehood do not seem important to her
she believe for instance have learnt it at school that the party have invent aeroplane
in his own schoolday Winston remember in the late fifty it be only the helicopter that the party claim to have invent a dozen year later when julia be at school it be already claim the aeroplane one generation more and it will be claim the steam engine
and when he tell her that aeroplane have be in existence before he be born and long before the revolution the fact strike her as totally uninteresting
after all what do it matter who have invent aeroplane
it be rather more of a shock to him when he discover from some chance remark that she do not remember that Oceania four year ago have be at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia
it be true that she regard the whole war as a sham but apparently she have not even notice that the name of the enemy have change
I think we have always be at war with Eurasia she say vague
it frighten him a little
the invention of aeroplane date from long before her birth but the switchover in the war have happen only four year ago well after she be grow up
he argue with her about it for perhaps a quarter of a hour
in the end he succeed in force her memory back until she do dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia have be the enemy
but the issue still strike her as unimportant
who care
she say impatiently
it be always one bloody war after another and one know the news be all lie anyway
sometimes he talk to her of the record department and the impudent forgery that he commit there
such thing do not appear to horrify her
she do not feel the abyss open beneath her foot at the thought of lie become truth
he tell her the story of jones aaronson and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he have once hold between his finger
it do not make much impression on her
at first indeed she fail to grasp the point of the story
be they friend of yours
she say
no I never know them
they be inner party member
besides they be far old man than I be
they belong to the old day before the revolution
I barely know them by sight
then what be there to worry about
people be be kill off all the time be+not they
he try to make her understand
this be a exceptional case
it be+not just a question of somebody be kill
do you realize that the past start from yesterday have be actually abolish
if it survive anywhere it be in a few solid object with no word attach to them like that lump of glass there
already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the year before the revolution
every record have be destroy or falsify every book have be rewrite every picture have be repaint every statue and street and building have be rename every date have be alter
and that process be continue day by day and minute by minute
history have stop
nothing exist except a endless present in which the party be always right
I know of course that the past be falsify but it will never be possible for me to prove it even when I do the falsification myself
after the thing be do no evidence ever remain
the only evidence be inside my own mind and I do+not know with any certainty that any other human being share my memory
just in that one instance in my whole life I do possess actual concrete evidence after the event year after it
and what good be that
it be no good because I throw it away a few minute later
but if the same thing happen today I shall keep it
well I would+not say julia
I be quite ready to take risk but only for something worth while not for bit of old newspaper
what can you have do with it even if you have keep it
not much perhaps
but it be evidence
it must have plant a few doubt here and there supposing that I have dare to show it to anybody
I do+not imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime
but one can imagine little knot of resistance spring up here and there small group of people band themselves together and gradually grow and even leave a few record behind so that the next generation can carry on where we leave off
I be not interested in the next generation dear
I be interested in us
you be only a rebel from the waist downwards he tell her
she think this brilliantly witty and fling her arm round him in delight
in the ramification of party doctrine she have not the faint interest
whenever he begin to talk of the principle of Ingsoc doublethink the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use Newspeak word she become boreed and confused and say that she never pay any attention to that kind of thing
one know that it be all rubbish so why let oneself be worry by it
she know when to cheer and when to boo and that be all one need
if he persist in talk of such subject she have a disconcert habit of fall asleep
she be one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position
talk to her he realize how easy it be to present a appearance of orthodoxy while have no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy mean
in a way the world-view of the party impose itself most successfully on people incapable of understand it
they can be make to accept the most flagrant violation of reality because they never fully grasp the enormity of what be demand of them and be not sufficiently interested in public event to notice what be happen
by lack of understanding they remain sane
they simply swallow everything and what they swallow do them no harm because it leave no residue behind just as a grain of corn will pass undigest through the body of a bird
it have happen at last
the expected message have come
all his life it seem to him he have be wait for this to happen
he be walk down the long corridor at the ministry and he be almost at the spot where julia have slip the note into his hand when he become aware that someone large than himself be walk just behind him
the person whoever it be give a small cough evidently as a prelude to speak
Winston stop abruptly and turn
it be O'Brien
at last they be face to face and it seem that his only impulse be to run away
his heart bound violently
he will have be incapable of speak
O'Brien however have continue forward in the same movement lay a friendly hand for a moment on Winston have arm so that the two of them be walk side by side
he begin speak with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiate him from the majority of inner party member
I have be hope for a opportunity of talk to you he say
I be read one of your Newspeak article in the Times the other day
you take a scholarly interest in Newspeak I believe
Winston have recover part of his self-possession
hardly scholarly he say
I be only a amateur
it be not my subject
I have never have anything to do with the actual construction of the language
but you write it very elegantly say O'Brien
that be not only my own opinion
I be talk recently to a friend of yours who be certainly a expert
his name have slip my memory for the moment
again Winston have heart stir painfully
it be inconceivable that this be anything other than a reference to Syme
but Syme be not only dead he be abolish a unperson
any identifiable reference to him will have be mortally dangerous
O'Brien have remark must obviously have be intend as a signal a codeword
by share a small act of thoughtcrime he have turn the two of them into accomplice
they have continue to stroll slowly down the corridor but now O'Brien halt
with the curious disarm friendliness that he always manage to put in to the gesture he resettle his spectacle on his nose
then he go on
what I have really intend to say be that in your article I notice you have use two word which have become obsolete
but they have only become so very recently
have you see the tenth edition of the Newspeak dictionary
no say Winston
I do+not think it have be issue yet
we be still use the ninth in the record department
the tenth edition be not due to appear for some month I believe
but a few advance copy have be circulate
I have one myself
it must interest you to look at it perhaps
Very much so say Winston immediately see where this tend
some of the new development be most ingenious
the reduction in the number of verb that be the point that will appeal to you I think
let me see shall I sent a messenger to you with the dictionary
but I be afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind
perhaps you can pick it up at my flat at some time that suit you
wait
let me give you my address
they be stand in front of a telescreen
somewhat absentmindedly O'Brien feel two of his pocket and then produce a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil
immediately beneath the telescreen in such a position that anyone who be watch at the other end of the instrument can read what he be write he scribble a address tear out the page and hand it to Winston
I be usually at home in the evening he say
if not my servant will give you the dictionary
he be go leave Winston hold the scrap of paper which this time there be no need to conceal
nevertheless he carefully memorize what be write on it and some hour later drop it into the memory hole along with a mass of other paper
they have be talk to one another for a couple of minute at the most
there be only one meaning that the episode can possibly have
it have be contrive as a way of let Winston know O'Brien have address
this be necessary because except by direct enquiry it be never possible to discover where anyone live
there be no directory of any kind
if you ever want to see me this be where I can be find be what O'Brien have be say to him
perhaps there will even be a message conceal somewhere in the dictionary
but at any rate one thing be certain
the conspiracy that he have dream of do exist and he have reach the outer edge of it
he know that sooner or later he will obey O'Brien have summons
perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delay he be not certain
what be happen be only the working-out of a process that have start year ago
the first step have be a secret involuntary thought the second have be the open of the diary
he have move from thought to word and now from word to action
the last step be something that will happen in the ministry of love
he have accept it
the end be contain in the beginning
but it be frightening or more exactly it be like a foretaste of death like be a little less alive
even while he be speak to O'Brien when the meaning of the word have sunk in a chilly shudder feeling have take possession of his body
he have the sensation of step into the dampness of a grave and it be not much good because he have always know that the grave be there and wait for him
Winston have wake up with his eye full of tear
julia roll sleepily against him murmur something that must have be what be the matter
I dreamt he begin and stop short
it be too complex to be put into word
there be the dream itself and there be a memory connect with it that have swim into his mind in the few second after wake
he lie back with his eye shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream
it be a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seem to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain
it have all occur inside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glass be the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything be flood with clear soft light in which one can see into interminable distance
the dream have also be comprehend by indeed in some sense it have consist in a gesture of the arm make by his mother and make again thirty year later by the Jewish woman he have see on the news film try to shelter the small boy from the bullet before the helicopter blow them both to piece
do you know he say that until this moment I believe I have murder my mother
why do you murder her
say julia almost asleep
I do+not murder her
not physically
in the dream he have remember his last glimpse of his mother and within a few moment of wake the cluster of small event surround it have all come back
it be a memory that he must have deliberately push out of his consciousness over many year
he be not certain of the date but he can not have be less than ten year old possibly twelve when it have happen
his father have disappear some time early how much early he can not remember
he remember better the rackety uneasy circumstance of the time the periodical panic about air-raid and the shelter in tube station the pile of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamation post at street corner the gang of youth in shirt all the same colour the enormous queue outside the bakery the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance above all the fact that there be never enough to eat
he remember long afternoon spend with other boy in scrounge round dustbin and rubbish heap pick out the rib of cabbage leaf potato peelings sometimes even scrap of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scrape away the cinder and also in wait for the pass of truck which travel over a certain route and be know to carry cattle feed and which when they jolt over the bad patch in the road sometimes spill a few fragment of oil-cake
when his father disappear his mother do not show any surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change come over her
she seem to have become completely spiritless
it be evident even to Winston that she be wait for something that she know must happen
she do everything that be need cook wash mend make the bed swept the floor dust the mantelpiece always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion like a artist have lay-figure move of its own accord
her large shapely body seem to relapse naturally into stillness
for hour at a time she will sit almost immobile on the bed nurse his young sister a tiny ail very silent child of two or three with a face make simian by thinness
Very occasionally she will take Winston in her arm and press him against her for a long time without say anything
he be aware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that this be somehow connect with the never-mentioned thing that be about to happen
he remember the room where they live a dark closesmelling room that seem half fill by a bed with a white counterpane
there be a gas ring in the fender and a shelf where food be keep and on the landing outside there be a brown earthenware sink common to several room
he remember his mother have statuesque body bend over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan
above all he remember his continuous hunger and the fierce sordid battle at mealtime
he will ask his mother naggingly over and over again why there be not more food he will shout and storm at her he even remember the tone of his voice which be begin to break prematurely and sometimes boom in a peculiar way or he will attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his effort to get more than his share
his mother be quite ready to give him more than his share
she take it for grant that he the boy shall have the big portion but however much she give him he invariably demand more
at every meal she will beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister be sick and also need food but it be no use
he will cry out with rage when she stop ladle he will try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hand he will grab bit from his sister have plate
he know that he be starve the other two but he can not help it he even feel that he have a right to do it
the clamorous hunger in his belly seem to justify him
between meal if his mother do not stand guard he be constantly pilfer at the wretched store of food on the shelf
one day a chocolate-ration be issue
there have be no such issue for week or month past
he remember quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate
it be a two-ounce slab they still talk about ounce in those day between the three of them
it be obvious that it ought to be divide into three equal part
suddenly as though he be listen to somebody else Winston hear himself demand in a loud boom voice that he shall be give the whole piece
his mother tell him not to be greedy
there be a long nagging argument that go round and round with shout whine tear remonstrance bargainings
his tiny sister cling to her mother with both hand exactly like a baby monkey sit look over her shoulder at him with large mournful eye
in the end his mother break off three-quarter of the chocolate and give it to Winston give the other quarter to his sister
the little girl take hold of it and look at it dully perhaps not know what it be
Winston stand watch her for a moment
then with a sudden swift spring he have snatch the piece of chocolate out of his sister have hand and be flee for the door
Winston Winston his mother call after him
come back
give your sister back her chocolate
he stop but do not come back
his mother have anxious eye be fix on his face
even now he be think about the thing he do not know what it be that be on the point of happen
his sister conscious of have be rob of something have set up a feeble wail
his mother draw her arm round the child and press its face against her breast
something in the gesture tell him that his sister be die
he turn and flee down the stair with the chocolate grow sticky in his hand
he never see his mother again
after he have devour the chocolate he feel somewhat ashamed of himself and hang about in the street for several hour until hunger drive him home
when he come back his mother have disappear
this be already become normal at that time
nothing be go from the room except his mother and his sister
they have not take any clothes not even his mother have overcoat
to this day he do not know with any certainty that his mother be dead
it be perfectly possible that she have merely be sent to a forced-labour camp
as for his sister she must have be remove like Winston himself to one of the colony for homeless child reclamation centre they be call which have grown up as a result of the civil war or she must have be sent to the labour camp along with his mother or simply leave somewhere or other to die
the dream be still vivid in his mind especially the envelop protect gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seem to be contain
his mind go back to another dream of two month ago
exactly as his mother have sit on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child cling to her so she have sit in the sunken ship far underneath him and drown deep every minute but still look up at him through the darken water
he tell julia the story of his mother have disappearance
without open her eye she roll over and settle herself into a more comfortable position
I expect you be a beastly little swine in those day she say indistinctly
all child be swine
yes
but the real point of the story
from her breathing it be evident that she be go off to sleep again
he will have like to continue talk about his mother
he do not suppose from what he can remember of her that she have be a unusual woman still less a intelligent one and yet she have possess a kind of nobility a kind of purity simply because the standard that she obey be private one
her feeling be her own and can not be alter from outside
it will not have occur to her that a action which be ineffectual thereby become meaningless
if you love someone you love him and when you have nothing else to give you still give him love
when the last of the chocolate be go his mother have clasp the child in her arm
it be no use it change nothing it do not produce more chocolate it do not avert the child have death or her own but it seem natural to her to do it
the refugee woman in the boat have also cover the little boy with her arm which be no more use against the bullet than a sheet of paper
the terrible thing that the party have do be to persuade you that mere impulse mere feeling be of no account while at the same time rob you of all power over the material world
when once you be in the grip of the party what you feel or do not feel what you do or refrain from do make literally no difference
whatever happen you vanish and neither you nor your action be ever hear of again
you be lift clean out of the stream of history
and yet to the people of only two generation ago this will not have seem all-important because they be not attempt to alter history
they be govern by private loyalty which they do not question
what matter be individual relationship and a completely helpless gesture a embrace a tear a word speak to a dying man can have value in itself
the prole it suddenly occur to him have remain in this condition
they be not loyal to a party or a country or a idea they be loyal to one another
for the first time in his life he do not despise the prole or think of them merely as a inert force which will one day spring to life and regenerate the world
the prole have stay human
they have not become harden inside
they have hold on to the primitive emotion which he himself have to re-learn by conscious effort
and in think this he remember without apparent relevance how a few week ago he have see a sever hand lie on the pavement and have kick it into the gutter as though it have be a cabbage-stalk
the prole be human being he say aloud
we be not human
why not
say julia who have wake up again
he think for a little while
have it ever occur to you he say that the good thing for us to do will be simply to walk out of here before it be too late and never see each other again
yes dear it have occur to me several time
but I be not go to do it all the same
we have be lucky he say but it can+not last much longer
you be young
you look normal and innocent
if you keep clear of people like me you must stay alive for another fifty year
no
I have think it all out
what you do I be go to do
and do+not be too downhearted
I be rather good at stay alive
we may be together for another six month a year there be no know
at the end we be certain to be apart
do you realize how utterly alone we shall be
when once they get hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing that either of us can do for the other
if I confess they will shoot you and if I refuse to confess they will shoot you just the same
nothing that I can do or say or stop myself from say will put off your death for as much as five minute
neither of us will even know whether the other be alive or dead
we shall be utterly without power of any kind
the one thing that matter be that we should+not betray one another although even that can+not make the slight difference
if you mean confess she say we shall do that right enough
everybody always confess
you can+not help it
they torture you
I do+not mean confess
confession be not betrayal
what you say or do do+not matter only feeling matter
if they can make me stop love you that will be the real betrayal
she think it over
they can+not do that she say finally
it be the one thing they can+not do
they can make you say anything anything but they can+not make you believe it
they can+not get inside you
no he say a little more hopefully no that be quite true
they can+not get inside you
if you can feel that stay human be worth while even when it can+not have any result whatever you have beat them
he think of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear
they can spy upon you night and day but if you keep your head you can still outwit them
with all their cleverness they have never master the secret of find out what another human being be think
perhaps that be less true when you be actually in their hand
one do not know what happen inside the ministry of love but it be possible to guess torture drug delicate instrument that register your nervous reaction gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning
fact at any rate can not be keep hide
they can be track down by enquiry they can be squeeze out of you by torture
but if the object be not to stay alive but to stay human what difference do it ultimately make
they can not alter your feeling for that matter you can not alter them yourself even if you want to
they can lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you have do or say or think but the inner heart whose workings be mysterious even to yourself remain impregnable
they have do it they have do it at last
the room they be stand in be long-shaped and softly light
the telescreen be dim to a low murmur the richness of the dark-blue carpet give one the impression of tread on velvet
at the far end of the room O'Brien be sit at a table under a green-shaded lamp with a mass of paper on either side of him
he have not bother to look up when the servant show julia and Winston in
Winston have heart be thump so hard that he doubt whether he will be able to speak
they have do it they have do it at last be all he can think
it have be a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive together though it be true that they have come by different route and only meet on O'Brien have doorstep
but merely to walk into such a place need a effort of the nerve
it be only on very rare occasion that one see inside the dwelling-places of the inner party or even penetrate into the quarter of the town where they live
the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flat the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smell of good food and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lift slide up and down the white-jacketed servant hurry to and fro everything be intimidate
although he have a good pretext for come here he be haunt at every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard will suddenly appear from round the corner demand his paper and order him to get out
O'Brien have servant however have admit the two of them without demur
he be a small dark-haired man in a white jacket with a diamond-shaped completely expressionless face which must have be that of a Chinese
the passage down which he lead them be softly carpet with cream-papered wall and white wainscoting all exquisitely clean
that too be intimidate
Winston can not remember ever to have see a passageway whose wall be not grimy from the contact of human body
O'Brien have a slip of paper between his finger and seem to be study it intently
his heavy face bend down so that one can see the line of the nose look both formidable and intelligent
for perhaps twenty second he sit without stir
then he pull the speakwrite towards him and rap out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries
item one comma five comma seven approve fullwise stop suggestion contain item six doubleplus ridiculous verge crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimate machinery overhead stop end message
he rise deliberately from his chair and come towards them across the soundless carpet
a little of the official atmosphere seem to have fall away from him with the Newspeak word but his expression be grim than usual as though he be not pleased at be disturb
the terror that Winston already feel be suddenly shoot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment
it seem to him quite possible that he have simply make a stupid mistake
for what evidence have he in reality that O'Brien be any kind of political conspirator
nothing but a flash of the eye and a single equivocal remark beyond that only his own secret imaginings found on a dream
he can not even fall back on the pretence that he have come to borrow the dictionary because in that case julia have presence be impossible to explain
as O'Brien pass the telescreen a thought seem to strike him
he stop turn aside and press a switch on the wall
there be a sharp snap
the voice have stop
julia utter a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise
even in the midst of his panic Winston be too much take aback to be able to hold his tongue
you can turn it off he say
yes say O'Brien we can turn it off
we have that privilege
he be opposite them now
his solid form tower over the pair of them and the expression on his face be still indecipherable
he be wait somewhat sternly for Winston to speak but about what
even now it be quite conceivable that he be simply a busy man wonder irritably why he have be interrupt
nobody speak
after the stop of the telescreen the room seem deadly silent
the second march past enormous
with difficulty Winston continue to keep his eye fix on O'Brien have
then suddenly the grim face break down into what must have be the beginning of a smile
with his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettle his spectacle on his nose
shall I say it or will you
he say
I will say it say Winston promptly
that thing be really turn off
yes everything be turn off
we be alone
we have come here because
he pause realize for the first time the vagueness of his own motive
since he do not in fact know what kind of help he expect from O'Brien it be not easy to say why he have come here
he go on conscious that what he be say must sound both feeble and pretentious
we believe that there be some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret organization work against the party and that you be involve in it
we want to join it and work for it
we be enemy of the party
we disbelieve in the principle of Ingsoc
we be thought-criminal
we be also adulterer
I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy
if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way we be ready
he stop and glance over his shoulder with the feeling that the door have open
sure enough the little yellow-faced servant have come in without knock
Winston see that he be carry a tray with a decanter and glass
martin be one of us say O'Brien impassive
bring the drink over here martin
put them on the round table
have we enough chair
then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort
bring a chair for yourself martin
this be business
you can stop be a servant for the next ten minute
the little man sit down quite at his ease and yet still with a servant-like air the air of a valet enjoy a privilege
Winston regard him out of the corner of his eye
it strike him that the man have whole life be play a part and that he feel it to be dangerous to drop his assume personality even for a moment
O'Brien take the decanter by the neck and fill up the glass with a dark-red liquid
it arouse in Winston dim memory of something see long ago on a wall or a hoarding a vast bottle compose of electric light which seem to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass
see from the top the stuff look almost black but in the decanter it gleam like a ruby
it have a sour-sweet smell
he see julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity
it be call wine say O'Brien with a faint smile
you will have read about it in book no doubt
not much of it get to the outer party I be afraid
his face grow solemn again and he raise his glass I think it be fitting that we shall begin by drink a health
to our leader to Emmanuel Goldstein
Winston take up his glass with a certain eagerness
wine be a thing he have read and dream about
like the glass paperweight or Mister charrington have half-remembered rhyme it belong to the vanish romantic past the olden time as he like to call it in his secret thought
for some reason he have always think of wine as have a intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam and a immediate intoxicate effect
actually when he come to swallow it the stuff be distinctly disappointing
the truth be that after year of gin-drinking he can barely taste it
he set down the empty glass
then there be such a person as Goldstein
he say
yes there be such a person and he be alive
where I do not know
and the conspiracy the organization
be it real
it be not simply a invention of the thought police
no it be real
the brotherhood we call it
you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exist and that you belong to it
I will come back to that presently
he look at his wrist-watch
it be unwise even for member of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half a hour
you ought not to have come here together and you will have to leave separately
you comrade he bow his head to julia will leave first
we have about twenty minute at our disposal
you will understand that I must start by ask you certain question
in general term what be you prepare to do
anything that we be capable of say Winston
O'Brien have turn himself a little in his chair so that he be face Winston
he almost ignore julia seem to take it for grant that Winston can speak for her
for a moment the lid flit down over his eye
he begin ask his question in a low expressionless voice as though this be a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answer be know to him already
you be prepare to give your life
yes
you be prepare to commit murder
yes
to commit act of sabotage which may cause the death of hundred of innocent people
yes
to betray your country to foreign power
yes
you be prepare to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the mind of child to distribute habit-forming drug to encourage prostitution to disseminate venereal disease to do anything which be likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party
yes
if for example it will somehow serve our interest to throw sulphuric acid in a child have face be you prepare to do that
yes
you be prepare to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock-worker
yes
you be prepare to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so
yes
you be prepare the two of you to separate and never see one another again
no break in julia
it appear to Winston that a long time pass before he answer
for a moment he seem even to have be deprive of the power of speech
his tongue work soundless form the opening syllable first of one word then of the other over and over again
until he have say it he do not know which word he be go to say
no he say finally
you do well to tell me say O'Brien
it be necessary for us to know everything
he turn himself toward julia and add in a voice with somewhat more expression in it
do you understand that even if he survive it may be as a different person
we may be obliged to give him a new identity
his face his movement the shape of his hand the colour of his hair even his voice will be different
and you yourself must have become a different person
our surgeon can alter people beyond recognition
sometimes it be necessary
sometimes we even amputate a limb
Winston can not help snatch another sidelong glance at martin have Mongolian face
there be no scar that he can see
julia have turn a shade pale so that her freckle be show but she face O'Brien boldly
she murmur something that seem to be assent
good
then that be settle
there be a silver box of cigarette on the table
with a rather absent-minded air O'Brien push them towards the others take one himself then stand up and begin to pace slowly to and fro as though he can think better stand
they be very good cigarette very thick and well-packed with a unfamiliar silkiness in the paper
O'Brien look at his wrist-watch again
you have better go back to your pantry martin he say
I shall switch on in a quarter of a hour
take a good look at these comrade face before you go
you will be see them again
I may not
exactly as they have do at the front door the little man have dark eye flicker over their face
there be not a trace of friendliness in his manner
he be memorize their appearance but he feel no interest in them or appear to feel none
it occur to Winston that a synthetic face be perhaps incapable of change its expression
without speak or give any kind of salutation martin go out close the door silently behind him
O'Brien be stroll up and down one hand in the pocket of his black overall the other hold his cigarette
you understand he say that you will be fight in the dark
you will always be in the dark
you will receive order and you will obey them without know why
later I shall sent you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in and the strategy by which we shall destroy it
when you have read the book you will be full member of the brotherhood
but between the general aim that we be fight for and the immediate task of the moment you will never know anything
I tell you that the brotherhood exist but I cannot tell you whether it number a hundred member or ten million
from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it number even as many as a dozen
you will have three or four contact who will be renew from time to time as they disappear
as this be your first contact it will be preserve
when you receive order they will come from me
if we find it necessary to communicate with you it will be through martin
when you be finally catch you will confess
that be unavoidable
but you will have very little to confess other than your own action
you will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people
probably you will not even betray me
by that time I may be dead or I shall have become a different person with a different face
he continue to move to and fro over the soft carpet
in spite of the bulkiness of his body there be a remarkable grace in his movement
it come out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulate a cigarette
more even than of strength he give a impression of confidence and of a understanding tinge by irony
however much in earnest he must be he have nothing of the single-mindedness that belong to a fanatic
when he speak of murder suicide venereal disease amputate limb and alter face it be with a faint air of persiflage
this be unavoidable his voice seem to say this be what we have get to do unflinchingly
but this be not what we shall be do when life be worth live again
a wave of admiration almost of worship flow out from Winston towards O'Brien
for the moment he have forget the shadowy figure of Goldstein
when you look at O'Brien have powerful shoulder and his blunt-featured face so ugly and yet so civilized it be impossible to believe that he can be defeat
there be no stratagem that he be not equal to no danger that he can not foresee
even julia seem to be impress
she have let her cigarette go out and be listen intently
O'Brien go on
you will have hear rumour of the existence of the brotherhood
no doubt you have form your own picture of it
you have imagine probably a huge underworld of conspirator meet secretly in cellar scribble message on wall recognize one another by codeword or by special movement of the hand
nothing of the kind exist
the member of the brotherhood have no way of recognize one another and it be impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others
Goldstein himself if he fall into the hand of the thought police can not give them a complete list of member or any information that will lead them to a complete list
no such list exist
the brotherhood cannot be wipe out because it be not a organization in the ordinary sense
nothing hold it together except a idea which be indestructible
you will never have anything to sustain you except the idea
you will get no comradeship and no encouragement
when finally you be catch you will get no help
we never help our member
at most when it be absolutely necessary that someone shall be silence we be occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner have cell
you will have to get use to live without result and without hope
you will work for a while you will be catch you will confess and then you will die
those be the only result that you will ever see
there be no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime
we be the dead
our only true life be in the future
we shall take part in it as handful of dust and splinter of bone
but how far away that future may be there be no know
it must be a thousand year
at present nothing be possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little
we cannot act collectively
we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual generation after generation
in the face of the thought police there be no other way
he halt and look for the third time at his wrist-watch
it be almost time for you to leave comrade he say to julia
wait
the decanter be still half full
he fill the glass and raise his own glass by the stem
what shall it be this time
he say still with the same faint suggestion of irony
to the confusion of the thought police
to the death of big brother
to humanity
to the future
to the past say Winston
the past be more important agree O'Brien gravely
they empty their glass and a moment later julia stand up to go
O'Brien take a small box from the top of a cabinet and hand her a flat white tablet which he tell her to place on her tongue
it be important he say not to go out smell of wine the lift attendant be very observant
as soon as the door have shut behind her he appear to forget her existence
he take another pace or two up and down then stop
there be detail to be settle he say
I assume that you have a hiding-place of some kind
Winston explain about the room over Mister charrington have shop
that will do for the moment
later we will arrange something else for you
it be important to change one have hiding-place frequently
meanwhile I shall sent you a copy of the book even O'Brien Winston notice seem to pronounce the word as though they be in italics Goldstein have book you understand as soon as possible
it may be some day before I can get hold of one
there be not many in existence as you can imagine
the thought police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them
it make very little difference
the book be indestructible
if the last copy be go we can reproduce it almost word for word
do you carry a brief-case to work with you
he add
as a rule yes
what be it like
black very shabby
with two strap
black two strap very shabby good
one day in the fairly near future I cannot give a date one of the message among your morning have work will contain a misprint word and you will have to ask for a repeat
on the following day you will go to work without your brief-case
at some time during the day in the street a man will touch you on the arm and say I think you have drop your brief-case
the one he give you will contain a copy of Goldstein have book
you will return it within fourteen day
they be silent for a moment
there be a couple of minute before you need go say O'Brien
we shall meet again if we do meet again
Winston look up at him
in the place where there be no darkness
he say hesitantly
O'Brien nod without appearance of surprise
in the place where there be no darkness he say as though he have recognize the allusion
and in the meantime be there anything that you wish to say before you leave
any message
any question
Winston think
there do not seem to be any further question that he want to ask still less do he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generality
instead of anything directly connect with O'Brien or the brotherhood there come into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother have spend her last day and the little room over Mister charrington have shop and the glass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame
almost at random he say
do you ever happen to hear a old rhyme that begin orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
again O'Brien nod
with a sort of grave courtesy he complete the stanza
orange and lemon say the bell of st clement have
you owe me three farthing say the bell of st martin have
when will you pay me say the bell of old bailey
when I grow rich say the bell of shoreditch
you know the last line say Winston
yes I know the last line
and now I be afraid it be time for you to go
but wait
you have better let me give you one of these tablet
as Winston stand up O'Brien hold out a hand
his powerful grip crush the bone of Winston have palm
at the door Winston look back but O'Brien seem already to be in process of put him out of mind
he be wait with his hand on the switch that control the telescreen
beyond him Winston can see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire basket deep-laden with paper
the incident be close
within thirty second it occur to him O'Brien will be back at his interrupt and important work on behalf of the party
Winston be gelatinous with fatigue
gelatinous be the right word
it have come into his head spontaneously
his body seem to have not only the weakness of a jelly but its translucency
he feel that if he hold up his hand he will be able to see the light through it
all the blood and lymph have be drain out of him by a enormous debauch of work leave only a frail structure of nerve bone and skin
all sensation seem to be magnify
his overall fret his shoulder the pavement tickle his foot even the open and close of a hand be a effort that make his joint creak
he have work more than ninety hour in five day
so have everyone else in the ministry
now it be all over and he have literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning
he can spend six hour in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed
slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walk up a dingy street in the direction of Mister charrington have shop keep one eye open for the patrol but irrationally convince that this afternoon there be no danger of anyone interfere with him
the heavy brief-case that he be carry bump against his knee at each step sent a tingle sensation up and down the skin of his leg
inside it be the book which he have now have in his possession for six day and have not yet open nor even look at
on the sixth day of hate week after the procession the speech the shouting the singing the banner the poster the film the waxwork the rolling of drum and squeal of trumpet the tramp of march foot the grind of the caterpillar of tank the roar of massed plane the boom of gun after six day of this when the great orgasm be quiver to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia have boil up into such delirium that if the crowd can have get their hand on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminal who be to be publicly hang on the last day of the proceedings they will unquestionably have torn them to piece at just this moment it have be announce that Oceania be not after all at war with Eurasia
Oceania be at war with Eastasia
Eurasia be a ally
there be of course no admission that any change have take place
merely it become know with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that Eastasia and not Eurasia be the enemy
Winston be take part in a demonstration in one of the central London square at the moment when it happen
it be night and the white face and the scarlet banner be luridly floodlight
the square be pack with several thousand people including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spy
on a scarlet-draped platform a orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arm and a large bald skull over which a few lank lock straggle be harangue the crowd
a little rumpelstiltskin figure contort with hatred he grip the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bony arm claw the air menacingly above his head
his voice make metallic by the amplifier boom forth a endless catalogue of atrocity massacre deportation lootings raping torture of prisoner bombing of civilian lie propaganda unjust aggression broken treaty
it be almost impossible to listen to him without be first convince and then madden
at every few moment the fury of the crowd boil over and the voice of the speaker be drown by a wild beast-like roar that rise uncontrollably from thousand of throat
the most savage yell of all come from the schoolchildren
the speech have be proceed for perhaps twenty minute when a messenger hurry on to the platform and a scrap of paper be slip into the speaker have hand
he unroll and read it without pause in his speech
nothing alter in his voice or manner or in the content of what he be say but suddenly the name be different
without word say a wave of understanding ripple through the crowd
Oceania be at war with Eastasia
the next moment there be a tremendous commotion
the banner and poster with which the square be decorate be all wrong
quite half of them have the wrong face on them
it be sabotage
the agent of Goldstein have be at work
there be a riotous interlude while poster be rip from the wall banner tear to shred and trample underfoot
the spy perform prodigy of activity in clamber over the rooftop and cut the streamer that flutter from the chimney
but within two or three minute it be all over
the orator still grip the neck of the microphone his shoulder hunched forward his free hand claw at the air have go straight on with his speech
one minute more and the feral roar of rage be again burst from the crowd
the hate continue exactly as before except that the target have be change
the thing that impress Winston in look back be that the speaker have switch from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but without even break the syntax
but at the moment he have other thing to preoccupy him
it be during the moment of disorder while the poster be be torn down that a man whose face he do not see have tap him on the shoulder and say excuse me I think you have drop your brief-case
he take the brief-case abstractedly without speak
he know that it will be day before he have a opportunity to look inside it
the instant that the demonstration be over he go straight to the ministry of truth though the time be now nearly twenty-three hour
the entire staff of the ministry have do likewise
the order already issue from the telescreen recall them to their post be hardly necessary
Oceania be at war with Eastasia Oceania have always be at war with Eastasia
a large part of the political literature of five year be now completely obsolete
report and record of all kind newspaper book pamphlet film sound-track photograph all have to be rectify at lightning speed
although no directive be ever issue it be know that the chief of the department intend that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia or the alliance with Eastasia shall remain in existence anywhere
the work be overwhelming all the more so because the process that it involve can not be call by their true name
everyone in the record department work eighteen hour in the twenty-four with two three-hour snatch of sleep
mattress be bring up from the cellar and pitch all over the corridor meal consist of sandwich and victory coffee wheel round on trolley by attendant from the canteen
each time that Winston break off for one of his spell of sleep he try to leave his desk clear of work and each time that he crawl back sticky-eyed and ache it be to find that another shower of paper cylinder have cover the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and overflow on to the floor so that the first job be always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work
what be bad of all be that the work be by no means purely mechanical
often it be enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of event demand care and imagination
even the geographical knowledge that one need in transfer the war from one part of the world to another be considerable
by the third day his eye ache unbearably and his spectacle need wipe every few minute
it be like struggle with some crushing physical task something which one have the right to refuse and which one be nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish
in so far as he have time to remember it he be not trouble by the fact that every word he murmur into the speakwrite every stroke of his ink-pencil be a deliberate lie
he be as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery shall be perfect
on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinder slow down
for as much as half a hour nothing come out of the tube then one more cylinder then nothing
everywhere at about the same time the work be ease off
a deep and as it be secret sigh go through the department
a mighty deed which can never be mention have be achieve
it be now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia have ever happen
at twelve hundred it be unexpectedly announce that all worker in the ministry be free till tomorrow morning
Winston still carry the brief-case contain the book which have remain between his foot while he work and under his body while he sleep go home shave himself and almost fall asleep in his bath although the water be barely more than tepid
with a sort of voluptuous creak in his joint he climb the stair above Mister charrington have shop
he be tired but not sleepy any longer
he open the window light the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee
julia will arrive presently meanwhile there be the book
he sit down in the sluttish armchair and undo the strap of the brief-case
a heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the cover
the print also look slightly irregular
the page be wear at the edge and fall apart easily as though the book have pass through many hand
the inscription on the title-page run
the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism by Emmanuel Goldstein
Winston begin read
chapter I
ignorance be strength
throughout record time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have be three kind of people in the world the high the middle and the low
they have be subdivide in many way they have bear countless different name and their relative number as well as their attitude towards one another have vary from age to age but the essential structure of society have never alter
even after enormous upheaval and seemingly irrevocable change the same pattern have always reassert itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it be push one way or the other
the aim of these group be entirely irreconcilable
Winston stop read chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he be read in comfort and safety
he be alone no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand
the sweet summer air play against his cheek
from somewhere far away there float the faint shout of child in the room itself there be no sound except the insect voice of the clock
he settle deep into the arm-chair and put his foot up on the fender
it be bliss it be eternity
suddenly as one sometimes do with a book of which one know that one will ultimately read and re-read every word he open it at a different place and find himself at chapter III
he go on read
chapter III
war be peace
the split up of the world into three great super-state be a event which can be and indeed be foresee before the middle of the twentieth century
with the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British empire by the united state two of the three existing power Eurasia and Oceania be already effectively in be
the third Eastasia only emerge as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting
the frontier between the three super-state be in some place arbitrary and in others they fluctuate accord to the fortune of war but in general they follow geographical line
Eurasia comprise the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass from Portugal to the bering strait
Oceania comprise the Americas the Atlantic island including the British isle Australasia and the southern portion of Africa
Eastasia small than the others and with a less definite western frontier comprise China and the country to the south of it the Japanese island and a large but fluctuate portion of manchuria Mongolia and Tibet
in one combination or another these three super-state be permanently at war and have be so for the past twenty-five year
war however be no longer the desperate annihilate struggle that it be in the early decade of the twentieth century
it be a warfare of limited aim between combatant who be unable to destroy one another have no material cause for fight and be not divide by any genuine ideological difference
this be not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards it have become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous
on the contrary war hysteria be continuous and universal in all country and such act as raping looting the slaughter of child the reduction of whole population to slavery and reprisal against prisoner which extend even to boil and bury alive be look upon as normal and when they be commit by one have own side and not by the enemy meritorious
but in a physical sense war involve very small number of people mostly highly-trained specialist and cause comparatively few casualty
the fighting when there be any take place on the vague frontier whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at or round the floating fortress which guard strategic spot on the sea lane
in the centre of civilization war mean no more than a continuous shortage of consumption good and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few score of death
war have in fact change its character
more exactly the reason for which war be wage have change in their order of importance
motive which be already present to some small extent in the great war of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and be consciously recognize and act upon
to understand the nature of the present war for in spite of the regroup which occur every few year it be always the same war one must realize in the first place that it be impossible for it to be decisive
none of the three super-state can be definitively conquer even by the other two in combination
they be too evenly match and their natural defence be too formidable
Eurasia be protect by its vast land space
Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitant
secondly there be no longer in a material sense anything to fight about
with the establishment of self-contained economy in which production and consumption be gear to one another the scramble for market which be a main cause of previous war have come to a end while the competition for raw material be no longer a mat of life and death
in any case each of the three super-state be so vast that it can obtain almost all the material that it need within its own boundary
in so far as the war have a direct economic purpose it be a war for labour power
between the frontier of the super-state and not permanently in the possession of any of them there lie a rough quadrilateral with its corner at tangy Brazzaville Darwin and hong kong contain within it about a fifth of the population of the earth
it be for the possession of these thickly-populated region and of the northern ice-cap that the three power be constantly struggle
in practice no one power ever control the whole of the disputeed area
portion of it be constantly change hand and it be the chance of seize this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictate the endless change of alignment
all of the disputed territory contain valuable mineral and some of them yield important vegetable product such as rubber which in cold climate it be necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive method
but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour
whichever power control equatorial Africa or the country of the middle east or southern India or the Indonesian archipelago dispose also of the body of score or hundred of million of ill-paid and hard-working coolie
the inhabitant of these area reduce more or less openly to the status of slave pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and be expend like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armament to capture more territory to control more labour power to turn out more armament to capture more territory and so on indefinitely
it shall be note that the fighting never really move beyond the edge of the disputed area
the frontier of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean the island of the Indian ocean and the Pacific be constantly be capture and recapture by Oceania or by Eastasia in Mongolia the divide line between Eurasia and Eastasia be never stable round the pole all three power lay claim to enormous territory which in fact be largely uninhabited and unexplored but the balance of power always remain roughly even and the territory which form the heartland of each super-state always remain inviolate
moreover the labour of the exploit people round the equator be not really necessary to the world have economy
they add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever they produce be use for purpose of war and the object of wage a war be always to be in a good position in which to wage another war
by their labour the slave population allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speed up
but if they do not exist the structure of world society and the process by which it maintain itself will not be essentially different
the primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principle of doublethink this aim be simultaneously recognize and not recognize by the direct brain of the inner party be to use up the product of the machine without raise the general standard of living
ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption good have be latent in industrial society
at present when few human being even have enough to eat this problem be obviously not urgent and it must not have become so even if no artificial process of destruction have be at work
the world of today be a bare hungry dilapidated place compare with the world that exist before 1914 and still more so if compare with the imaginary future to which the people of that period look forward
in the early twentieth century the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficient a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete be part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person
science and technology be develop at a prodigious speed and it seem natural to assume that they will go on develop
this fail to happen partly because of the impoverishment cause by a long series of war and revolution partly because scientific and technical progress depend on the empirical habit of thought which can not survive in a strictly regiment society
as a whole the world be more primitive today than it be fifty year ago
certain backward area have advance and various device always in some way connect with warfare and police espionage have be develop but experiment and invention have largely stop and the ravage of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never be fully repair
nevertheless the danger inherent in the machine be still there
from the moment when the machine first make its appearance it be clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality have disappear
if the machine be use deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease can be eliminate within a few generation
and in fact without be use for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic process by produce wealth which it be sometimes impossible not to distribute the machine do raise the living standard of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty year at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century
but it be also clear that a all-round increase in wealth threaten the destruction indeed in some sense be the destruction of a hierarchical society
in a world in which everyone work short hour have enough to eat live in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possess a motor-car or even a aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality will already have disappear
if it once become general wealth will confer no distinction
it be possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possession and luxury shall be evenly distribute while power remain in the hand of a small privileged caste
but in practice such a society can not long remain stable
for if leisure and security be enjoy by all alike the great mass of human being who be normally stupefy by poverty will become literate and will learn to think for themselves and when once they have do this they will sooner or later realize that the privileged minority have no function and they will sweep it away
in the long run a hierarchical society be only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance
to return to the agricultural past as some thinker about the beginning of the twentieth century dream of do be not a practicable solution
it conflict with the tendency towards mechanization which have become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remain industrially backward be helpless in a military sense and be bound to be dominate directly or indirectly by its more advanced rival
nor be it a satisfactory solution to keep the mass in poverty by restrict the output of good
this happen to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between 1920 and 1940
the economy of many country be allow to stagnate land go out of cultivation capital equipment be not add to great block of the population be prevent from work and keep half alive by state charity
but this too entail military weakness and since the privation it inflict be obviously unnecessary it make opposition inevitable
the problem be how to keep the wheel of industry turn without increase the real wealth of the world
good must be produce but they must not be distribute
and in practice the only way of achieve this be by continuous warfare
the essential act of war be destruction not necessarily of human life but of the product of human labour
war be a way of shatter to piece or pour into the stratosphere or sink in the depth of the sea material which must otherwise be use to make the mass too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent
even when weapon of war be not actually destroy their manufacture be still a convenient way of expend labour power without produce anything that can be consume
a floating fortress for example have lock up in it the labour that will build several hundred cargo-ships
ultimately it be scrap as obsolete never have bring any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labour another floating fortress be build
in principle the war effort be always so plan as to eat up any surplus that must exist after meet the bare need of the population
in practice the need of the population be always underestimate with the result that there be a chronic shortage of half the necessity of life but this be look on as a advantage
it be deliberate policy to keep even the favour group somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increase the importance of small privilege and thus magnify the distinction between one group and another
by the standard of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party live a austere laborious kind of life
nevertheless the few luxury that he do enjoy his large well-appointed flat the good texture of his clothes the good quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two or three servant his private motor-car or helicopter set him in a different world from a member of the outer party and the member of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged mass whom we call the prole
the social atmosphere be that of a besiege city where the possession of a lump of horseflesh make the difference between wealth and poverty
and at the same time the consciousness of be at war and therefore in danger make the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural unavoidable condition of survival
war it will be see accomplish the necessary destruction but accomplish it in a psychologically acceptable way
in principle it will be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by build temple and pyramid by dig hole and fill them up again or even by produce vast quantity of good and then set fire to them
but this will provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society
what be concern here be not the morale of mass whose attitude be unimportant so long as they be keep steadily at work but the morale of the party itself
even the humble party member be expect to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limit but it be also necessary that he shall be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing mood be fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph
in other word it be necessary that he shall have the mentality appropriate to a state of war
it do not matter whether the war be actually happen and since no decisive victory be possible it do not matter whether the war be go well or badly
all that be need be that a state of war shall exist
the split of the intelligence which the party require of its member and which be more easily achieve in a atmosphere of war be now almost universal but the high up the rank one go the more marked it become
it be precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy be strong
in his capacity as a administrator it be often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news be untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war be spurious and be either not happen or be be wage for purpose quite other than the declare one but such knowledge be easily neutralize by the technique of doublethink
meanwhile no inner party member waver for a instant in his mystical belief that the war be real and that it be bound to end victoriously with Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world
all member of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as a article of faith
it be to be achieve either by gradually acquire more and more territory and so build up a overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon
the search for new weapon continue unceasingly and be one of the very few remaining activity in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet
in Oceania at the present day science in the old sense have almost cease to exist
in Newspeak there be no word for science
the empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievement of the past be found be oppose to the most fundamental principle of Ingsoc
and even technological progress only happen when its product can in some way be use for the diminution of human liberty
in all the useful art the world be either stand still or go backwards
the field be cultivate with horse-ploughs while book be write by machinery
but in matter of vital importance mean in effect war and police espionage the empirical approach be still encourage or at least tolerate
the two aim of the party be to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought
there be therefore two great problem which the party be concerned to solve
one be how to discover against his will what another human being be think and the other be how to kill several hundred million people in a few second without give warning beforehand
in so far as scientific research still continue this be its subject matter
the scientist of today be either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor study with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expression gesture and tone of voice and test the truth-producing effect of drug shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he be chemist physicist or biologist concern only with such branch of his special subject as be relevant to the taking of life
in the vast laboratory of the ministry of peace and in the experimental station hide in the Brazilian forest or in the Australian desert or on lost island of the Antarctic the team of expert be indefatigably at work
some be concern simply with plan the logistics of future war others devise large and large rocket bomb more and more powerful explosive and more and more impenetrable armour-plating others search for new and deadly gas or for soluble poison capable of be produce in such quantity as to destroy the vegetation of whole continent or for breed of disease germ immunize against all possible antibody others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or a aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship others explore even remote possibility such as focus the sun have ray through lens suspend thousand of kilometre away in space or produce artificial earthquake and tidal wave by tap the heat at the earth have centre
but none of these project ever come anywhere near realization and none of the three super-state ever gain a significant lead on the others
what be more remarkable be that all three power already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their present research be likely to discover
although the party accord to its habit claim the invention for itself atomic bomb first appear as early as the nineteen-forties and be first use on a large scale about ten year later
at that time some hundred of bomb be drop on industrial centre chiefly in European Russia western Europe and north America
the effect be to convince the ruling group of all country that a few more atomic bomb will mean the end of organized society and hence of their own power
thereafter although no formal agreement be ever make or hint at no more bomb be drop
all three power merely continue to produce atomic bomb and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later
and meanwhile the art of war have remain almost stationary for thirty or forty year
helicopter be more use than they be formerly bombing plane have be largely supersede by self-propelled projectile and the fragile movable battleship have give way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress but otherwise there have be little development
the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade be still in use
and in spite of the endless slaughter report in the press and on the telescreen the desperate battle of early war in which hundred of thousand or even million of man be often kill in a few week have never be repeat
none of the three super-state ever attempt any manoeuvre which involve the risk of serious defeat
when any large operation be undertake it be usually a surprise attack against a ally
the strategy that all three power be follow or pretend to themselves that they be follow be the same
the plan be by a combination of fighting bargain and well-timed stroke of treachery to acquire a ring of basis completely encircle one or other of the rival state and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful term for so many year as to lull suspicion to sleep
during this time rocket load with atomic bomb can be assemble at all the strategic spot finally they will all be fire simultaneously with effect so devastating as to make retaliation impossible
it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power in preparation for another attack
this scheme it be hardly necessary to say be a mere daydream impossible of realization
moreover no fighting ever occur except in the disputed area round the equator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory be ever undertake
this explain the fact that in some place the frontier between the superstates be arbitrary
Eurasia for example can easily conquer the British isle which be geographically part of Europe or on the other hand it will be possible for Oceania to push its frontier to the Rhine or even to the vistula
but this will violate the principle follow on all side though never formulate of cultural integrity
if Oceania be to conquer the area that use once to be know as France and Germany it will be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitant a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development go be roughly on the oceanic level
the problem be the same for all three super-state
it be absolutely necessary to their structure that there shall be no contact with foreigner except to a limited extent with war prisoner and coloured slave
even the official ally of the moment be always regard with the dark suspicion
war prisoner apart the average citizen of Oceania never set eye on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia and he be forbid the knowledge of foreign language
if he be allow contact with foreigner he will discover that they be creature similar to himself and that most of what he have be tell about them be lie
the seal world in which he live will be broken and the fear hatred and self-righteousness on which his morale depend must evaporate
it be therefore realize on all side that however often Persia or Egypt or Java or Ceylon may change hand the main frontier must never be cross by anything except bomb
under this lie a fact never mention aloud but tacit understand and act upon namely that the condition of life in all three super-state be very much the same
in Oceania the prevailing philosophy be call Ingsoc in Eurasia it be call Neo-Bolshevism and in Eastasia it be call by a Chinese name usually translate as Death-Worship but perhaps better render as obliteration of the self
the citizen of Oceania be not allow to know anything of the tenet of the other two philosophy but he be teach to execrate them as barbarous outrage upon morality and common sense
actually the three philosophy be barely distinguishable and the social system which they support be not distinguishable at all
everywhere there be the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semi-divine leader the same economy exist by and for continuous warfare
it follow that the three super-state not only cannot conquer one another but will gain no advantage by do so
on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like three sheaf of corn
and as usual the ruling group of all three power be simultaneously aware and unaware of what they be do
their life be dedicate to world conquest but they also know that it be necessary that the war shall continue everlastingly and without victory
meanwhile the fact that there be no danger of conquest make possible the denial of reality which be the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival system of thought
here it be necessary to repeat what have be say early that by become continuous war have fundamentally change its character
in past age a war almost by definition be something that sooner or later come to a end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat
in the past also war be one of the main instrument by which human society be keep in touch with physical reality
all ruler in all age have try to impose a false view of the world upon their follower but they can not afford to encourage any illusion that tend to impair military efficiency
so long as defeat mean the loss of independence or some other result generally hold to be undesirable the precaution against defeat have to be serious
physical fact can not be ignore
in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two must make five but when one be design a gun or a aeroplane they have to make four
inefficient nation be always conquer sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency be inimical to illusion
moreover to be efficient it be necessary to be able to learn from the past which mean have a fairly accurate idea of what have happen in the past
newspaper and history book be of course always coloured and biased but falsification of the kind that be practise today will have be impossible
war be a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling class be concern it be probably the most important of all safeguard
while war can be win or lose no ruling class can be completely irresponsible
but when war become literally continuous it also cease to be dangerous
when war be continuous there be no such thing as military necessity
technical progress can cease and the most palpable fact can be deny or disregard
as we have see research that can be call scientific be still carry out for the purpose of war but they be essentially a kind of daydream and their failure to show result be not important
efficiency even military efficiency be no longer need
nothing be efficient in Oceania except the thought police
since each of the three super-state be unconquerable each be in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practise
reality only exert its pressure through the need of everyday life the need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallow poison or step out of top-storey window and the like
between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there be still a distinction but that be all
cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of Oceania be like a man in interstellar space who have no way of know which direction be up and which be down
the ruler of such a state be absolute as the pharaoh or the caesar can not be
they be obliged to prevent their follower from starve to death in number large enough to be inconvenient and they be obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rival but once that minimum be achieve they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose
the war therefore if we judge it by the standard of previous war be merely a imposture
it be like the battle between certain ruminant animal whose horn be set at such a angle that they be incapable of hurt one another
but though it be unreal it be not meaningless
it eat up the surplus of consumable good and it help to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society need
war it will be see be now a purely internal affair
in the past the ruling group of all country although they must recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war do fight against one another and the victor always plunder the vanquish
in our own day they be not fight against one another at all
the war be wage by each ruling group against its own subject and the object of the war be not to make or prevent conquest of territory but to keep the structure of society intact
the very word war therefore have become misleading
it will probably be accurate to say that by become continuous war have cease to exist
the peculiar pressure that it exert on human being between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century have disappear and be replace by something quite different
the effect will be much the same if the three super-state instead of fight one another shall agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundary
for in that case each will still be a self-contained universe free for ever from the sober influence of external danger
a peace that be truly permanent will be the same as a permanent war
this although the vast majority of party member understand it only in a shallow sense be the inner meaning of the party slogan war be peace
Winston stop read for a moment
somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thunder
the blissful feeling of be alone with the forbidden book in a room with no telescreen have not wear off
solitude and safety be physical sensation mix up somehow with the tiredness of his body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that play upon his cheek
the book fascinate him or more exactly it reassure him
in a sense it tell him nothing that be new but that be part of the attraction
it say what he will have say if it have be possible for him to set his scattered thought in order
it be the product of a mind similar to his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fear-ridden
the good book he perceive be those that tell you what you know already
he have just turn back to chapter I when he hear julia have footstep on the stair and start out of his chair to meet her
she dump her brown tool-bag on the floor and fling herself into his arm
it be more than a week since they have see one another
I have get the book he say as they disentangle themselves
oh you have get it
good she say without much interest and almost immediately kneel down beside the oilstove to make the coffee
they do not return to the subject until they have be in bed for half a hour
the evening be just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane
from below come the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boot on the flagstone
the brawny red-armed woman whom Winston have see there on his first visit be almost a fixture in the yard
there seem to be no hour of daylight when she be not march to and fro between the washtub and the line alternately gag herself with clothes peg and break forth into lusty song
julia have settle down on her side and seem to be already on the point of fall asleep
he reach out for the book which be lie on the floor and sit up against the bedhead
we must read it he say
you too
all member of the brotherhood have to read it
you read it she say with her eye shut
read it aloud
that be the good way
then you can explain it to me as you go
the clock have hand say six mean eighteen
they have three or four hour ahead of them
he prop the book against his knee and begin read
chapter I
ignorance be strength
throughout redord time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have be three kind of people in the world the high the middle and the low
they have be subdivide in many way they have bear countless different name and their relative number as well as their attitude towards one another have vary from age to age but the essential structure of society have never alter
even after enormous upheaval and seemingly irrevocable change the same pattern have always reassert itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it be push one way or the other
julia be you awake
say Winston
yes my love I be listen
go on
it be marvellous
he continue read
the aim of these three group be entirely irreconcilable
the aim of the high be to remain where they be
the aim of the middle be to change place with the high
the aim of the low when they have a aim for it be a abiding characteristic of the low that they be too much crush by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily life be to abolish all distinction and create a society in which all man shall be equal
thus throughout history a struggle which be the same in its main outline recur over and over again
for long period the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always come a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently or both
they be then overthrow by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretend to them that they be fight for liberty and justice
as soon as they have reach their objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high
presently a new middle group split off from one of the other group or from both of them and the struggle begin over again
of the three group only the low be never even temporarily successful in achieve their aim
it will be a exaggeration to say that throughout history there have be no progress of a material kind
even today in a period of decline the average human being be physically better off than he be a few century ago
but no advance in wealth no soften of manner no reform or revolution have ever bring human equality a millimetre nearer
from the point of view of the low no historic change have ever mean much more than a change in the name of their master
by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern have become obvious to many observer
there then rise school of thinker who interpret history as a cyclical process and claim to show that inequality be the unalterable law of human life
this doctrine of course have always have its adherent but in the manner in which it be now put forward there be a significant change
in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society have be the doctrine specifically of the high
it have be preach by king and aristocrat and by the priest lawyer and the like who be parasitical upon them and it have generally be soften by promise of compensation in a imaginary world beyond the grave
the middle so long as it be struggle for power have always make use of such term as freedom justice and fraternity
now however the concept of human brotherhood begin to be assail by people who be not yet in position of command but merely hope to be so before long
in the past the middle have make revolution under the banner of equality and then have establish a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one be overthrow
the new middle group in effect proclaim their tyranny beforehand
socialism a theory which appear in the early nineteenth century and be the last link in a chain of thought stretch back to the slave rebellion of antiquity be still deeply infect by the utopianism of past age
but in each variant of socialism that appear from about 1900 onwards the aim of establish liberty and equality be more and more openly abandon
the new movement which appear in the middle year of the century Ingsoc in Oceania Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia Death-Worship as it be commonly call in Eastasia have the conscious aim of perpetuate unfreedom and inequality
these new movement of course grow out of the old one and tend to keep their name and pay lip-service to their ideology
but the purpose of all of them be to arrest progress and freeze history at a choose moment
the familiar pendulum swing be to happen once more and then stop
as usual the high be to be turn out by the middle who will then become the high but this time by conscious strategy the high will be able to maintain their position permanently
the new doctrine arise partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which have hardly exist before the nineteenth century
the cyclical movement of history be now intelligible or appear to be so and if it be intelligible then it be alterable
but the principal underlying cause be that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality have become technically possible
it be still true that man be not equal in their native talent and that function have to be specialize in way that favour some individual against others but there be no longer any real need for class distinction or for large difference of wealth
in early age class distinction have be not only inevitable but desirable
inequality be the price of civilization
with the development of machine production however the case be alter
even if it be still necessary for human being to do different kind of work it be no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic level
therefore from the point of view of the new group who be on the point of seize power human equality be no longer a ideal to be strive after but a danger to be avert
in more primitive age when a just and peaceful society be in fact not possible it have be fairly easy to believe it
the idea of a earthly paradise in which man shall live together in a state of brotherhood without law and without brute labour have haunt the human imagination for thousand of year
and this vision have have a certain hold even on the group who actually profit by each historical change
the heir of the French English and American revolution have partly believe in their own phrase about the right of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and have even allow their conduct to be influence by them to some extent
but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main current of political thought be authoritarian
the earthly paradise have be discredit at exactly the moment when it become realizable
every new political theory by whatever name it call itself lead back to hierarchy and regimentation
and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930 practice which have be long abandon in some case for hundred of year imprisonment without trial the use of war prisoner as slave public execution torture to extract confession the use of hostage and the deportation of whole population not only become common again but be tolerate and even defend by people who consider themselves enlightened and progressive
it be only after a decade of national war civil war revolution and counter-revolution in all part of the world that Ingsoc and its rival emerge as fully worked-out political theory
but they have be foreshadow by the various system generally call totalitarian which have appear early in the century and the main outline of the world which will emerge from the prevailing chaos have long be obvious
what kind of people will control this world have be equally obvious
the new aristocracy be make up for the most part of bureaucrat scientist technician trade-union organizer publicity expert sociologist teacher journalist and professional politician
these people whose origin lie in the salaried middle class and the upper grade of the working class have be shape and bring together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralize government
as compare with their opposite number in past age they be less avaricious less tempt by luxury hungry for pure power and above all more conscious of what they be do and more intent on crush opposition
this last difference be cardinal
by comparison with that exist today all the tyranny of the past be half-hearted and inefficient
the ruling group be always infect to some extent by liberal idea and be content to leave loose end everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subject be think
even the Catholic church of the middle age be tolerant by modern standard
part of the reason for this be that in the past no government have the power to keep its citizen under constant surveillance
the invention of print however make it easy to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carry the process further
with the development of television and the technical advance which make it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life come to a end
every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watch can be keep for twentyfour hour a day under the eye of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channel of communication close
the possibility of enforce not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subject now exist for the first time
after the revolutionary period of the fifty and sixties society regroup itself as always into high middle and low
but the new high group unlike all its forerunner do not act upon instinct but know what be need to safeguard its position
it have long be realize that the only secure basis for oligarchy be collectivism
wealth and privilege be most easily defend when they be possess jointly
the so-called abolition of private property which take place in the middle year of the century mean in effect the concentration of property in far few hand than before but with this difference that the new owner be a group instead of a mass of individual
individually no member of the party own anything except petty personal belonging
collectively the party own everything in Oceania because it control everything and dispose of the product as it think fit
in the year follow the revolution it be able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process be represent as a act of collectivization
it have always be assume that if the capitalist class be expropriate socialism must follow and unquestionably the capitalist have be expropriate
factory mine land house transport everything have be take away from them and since these thing be no longer private property it follow that they must be public property
Ingsoc which grow out of the early socialist movement and inherit its phraseology have in fact carry out the main item in the socialist programme with the result foresee and intend beforehand that economic inequality have be make permanent
but the problem of perpetuate a hierarchical society go deep than this
there be only four way in which a ruling group can fall from power
either it be conquer from without or it govern so inefficiently that the mass be stir to revolt or it allow a strong and discontented middle group to come into be or it lose its own self-confidence and willingness to govern
these cause do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them be present in some degree
a ruling class which can guard against all of them will remain in power permanently
ultimately the determine factor be the mental attitude of the ruling class itself
after the middle of the present century the first danger have in reality disappear
each of the three power which now divide the world be in fact unconquerable and can only become conquerable through slow demographic change which a government with wide power can easily avert
the second danger also be only a theoretical one
the mass never revolt of their own accord and they never revolt merely because they be oppress
indeed so long as they be not permit to have standard of comparison they never even become aware that they be oppress
the recurrent economic crisis of past time be totally unnecessary and be not now permit to happen but other and equally large dislocation can and do happen without have political result because there be no way in which discontent can become articulate
as for the problem of overproduction which have be latent in our society since the development of machine technique it be solve by the device of continuous warfare see chapter III which be also useful in key up public morale to the necessary pitch
from the point of view of our present ruler therefore the only genuine danger be the splitting-off of a new group of able underemployed power-hungry people and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own rank
the problem that be to say be educational
it be a problem of continuously mould the consciousness both of the direct group and of the large executive group that lie immediately below it
the consciousness of the mass need only to be influence in a negative way
give this background one can infer if one do not know it already the general structure of oceanic society
at the apex of the pyramid come big brother
big brother be infallible and all-powerful
every success every achievement every victory every scientific discovery all knowledge all wisdom all happiness all virtue be hold to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration
nobody have ever see big brother
he be a face on the hoarding a voice on the telescreen
we may be reasonably sure that he will never die and there be already considerable uncertainty as to when he be born
big brother be the guise in which the party choose to exhibit itself to the world
his function be to act as a focus point for love fear and reverence emotion which be more easily feel towards a individual than towards a organization
below big brother come the inner party its number limit to six million or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania
below the inner party come the outer party which if the inner party be describe as the brain of the state may be justly liken to the hand
below that come the dumb mass whom we habitually refer to as the prole number perhaps 85 per cent of the population
in the term of our early classification the prole be the low for the slave population of the equatorial land who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror be not a permanent or necessary part of the structure
in principle membership of these three group be not hereditary
the child of inner party parent be in theory not born into the inner party
admission to either branch of the party be by examination take at the age of sixteen
nor be there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another
Jew Negro south American of pure Indian blood be to be found in the high rank of the party and the administrator of any area be always draw from the inhabitant of that area
in no part of Oceania do the inhabitant have the feeling that they be a colonial population rule from a distant capital
Oceania have no capital and its titular head be a person whose whereabouts nobody know
except that English be its chief lingua franca and Newspeak its official language it be not centralize in any way
its ruler be not hold together by blood-tie but by adherence to a common doctrine
it be true that our society be stratify and very rigidly stratify on what at first sight appear to be hereditary line
there be far less to-and-fro movement between the different group than happen under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age
between the two branch of the party there be a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weakling be exclude from the inner party and that ambitious member of the outer party be make harmless by allow them to rise
proletarian in practice be not allow to graduate into the party
the most gifted among them who must possibly become nucleus of discontent be simply mark down by the thought police and eliminate
but this state of affair be not necessarily permanent nor be it a matter of principle
the party be not a class in the old sense of the word
it do not aim at transmit power to its own child as such and if there be no other way of keep the able people at the top it will be perfectly prepare to recruit a entire new generation from the rank of the proletariat
in the crucial year the fact that the party be not a hereditary body do a great deal to neutralize opposition
the old kind of socialist who have be train to fight against something call class privilege assume that what be not hereditary cannot be permanent
he do not see that the continuity of a oligarchy need not be physical nor do he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracy have always be shortlived whereas adoptive organization such as the Catholic church have sometimes last for hundred or thousand of year
the essence of oligarchical rule be not father-to-son inheritance but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life impose by the dead upon the living
a ruling group be a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successor
the party be not concerned with perpetuate its blood but with perpetuate itself
who wield power be not important provided that the hierarchical structure remain always the same
all the belief habit taste emotion mental attitude that characterize our time be really design to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from be perceive
physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellion be at present not possible
from the proletarian nothing be to be fear
leave to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century work breed and die not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasp that the world can be other than it be
they can only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique make it necessary to educate them more highly but since military and commercial rivalry be no longer important the level of popular education be actually decline
what opinion the mass hold or do not hold be look on as a matter of indifference
they can be grant intellectual liberty because they have no intellect
in a party member on the other hand not even the small deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerate
a party member live from birth to death under the eye of the thought police
even when he be alone he can never be sure that he be alone
wherever he may be asleep or awake work or rest in his bath or in bed he can be inspect without warning and without know that he be be inspect
nothing that he do be indifferent
his friendship his relaxation his behaviour towards his wife and child the expression of his face when he be alone the word he mutter in sleep even the characteristic movement of his body be all jealously scrutinize
not only any actual misdemeanour but any eccentricity however small any change of habit any nervous mannerism that can possibly be the symptom of a inner struggle be certain to be detect
he have no freedom of choice in any direction whatever
on the other hand his action be not regulate by law or by any clearly formulate code of behaviour
in Oceania there be no law
thought and action which when detect mean certain death be not formally forbid and the endless purge arrest torture imprisonment and vaporization be not inflict as punishment for crime which have actually be commit but be merely the wiping-out of person who must perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future
a party member be require to have not only the right opinion but the right instinct
many of the belief and attitude demand of him be never plainly state and can not be state without lay bare the contradiction inherent in Ingsoc
if he be a person naturally orthodox in Newspeak a goodthinker he will in all circumstance know without take thought what be the true belief or the desirable emotion
but in any case a elaborate mental train undergo in childhood and group itself round the Newspeak word crimestop blackwhite and doublethink make him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever
a party member be expect to have no private emotion and no respite from enthusiasm
he be supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemy and internal traitor triumph over victory and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the party
the discontent produce by his bare unsatisfying life be deliberately turn outwards and dissipate by such device as the two minute hate and the speculation which must possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude be kill in advance by his early acquire inner discipline
the first and simple stage in the discipline which can be teach even to young child be call in Newspeak crimestop
crimestop mean the faculty of stop short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought
it include the power of not grasp analogy of failing to perceive logical error of misunderstand the simple argument if they be inimical to Ingsoc and of be bore or repel by any train of thought which be capable of lead in a heretical direction
crimestop in short mean protective stupidity
but stupidity be not enough
on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demand a control over one have own mental process as complete as that of a contortionist over his body
oceanic society rest ultimately on the belief that big brother be omnipotent and that the party be infallible
but since in reality big brother be not omnipotent and the party be not infallible there be need for a unwearying moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of fact
the keyword here be blackwhite
like so many Newspeak word this word have two mutually contradictory meaning
apply to a opponent it mean the habit of impudently claim that black be white in contradiction of the plain fact
apply to a party member it mean a loyal willingness to say that black be white when party discipline demand this
but it mean also the ability to believe that black be white and more to know that black be white and to forget that one have ever believe the contrary
this demand a continuous alteration of the past make possible by the system of thought which really embrace all the rest and which be know in Newspeak as doublethink
the alteration of the past be necessary for two reason one of which be subsidiary and so to speak precautionary
the subsidiary reason be that the party member like the proletarian tolerate present-day condition partly because he have no standard of comparison
he must be cut off from the past just as he must be cut off from foreign country because it be necessary for him to believe that he be better off than his ancestor and that the average level of material comfort be constantly rise
but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past be the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party
it be not merely that speech statistics and record of every kind must be constantly bring up to date in order to show that the prediction of the party be in all case right
it be also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admit
for to change one have mind or even one have policy be a confession of weakness
if for example Eurasia or Eastasia whichever it may be be the enemy today then that country must always have be the enemy
and if the fact say otherwise then the fact must be alter
thus history be continuously rewrite
this day-to-day falsification of the past carry out by the ministry of truth be as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carry out by the ministry of love
the mutability of the past be the central tenet of Ingsoc
past event it be argue have no objective existence but survive only in write record and in human memory
the past be whatever the record and the memory agree upon
and since the party be in full control of all record and in equally full control of the mind of its member it follow that the past be whatever the party choose to make it
it also follow that though the past be alterable it never have be alter in any specific instance
for when it have be recreate in whatever shape be need at the moment then this new version be the past and no different past can ever have exist
this hold good even when as often happen the same event have to be alter out of recognition several time in the course of a year
at all time the party be in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have be different from what it be now
it will be see that the control of the past depend above all on the train of memory
to make sure that all write record agree with the orthodoxy of the moment be merely a mechanical act
but it be also necessary to remember that event happen in the desire manner
and if it be necessary to rearrange one have memory or to tamper with write record then it be necessary to forget that one have do so
the trick of do this can be learn like any other mental technique
it be learn by the majority of party member and certainly by all who be intelligent as well as orthodox
in oldspeak it be call quite frankly reality control
in Newspeak it be call doublethink though doublethink comprise much else as well
doublethink mean the power of hold two contradictory belief in one have mind simultaneously and accept both of them
the party intellectual know in which direction his memory must be alter he therefore know that he be play trick with reality but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfy himself that reality be not violate
the process have to be conscious or it will not be carry out with sufficient precision but it also have to be unconscious or it will bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt
doublethink lie at the very heart of Ingsoc since the essential act of the party be to use conscious deception while retain the firmness of purpose that go with complete honesty
to tell deliberate lie while genuinely believe in them to forget any fact that have become inconvenient and then when it become necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it be need to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one deny all this be indispensably necessary
even in use the word doublethink it be necessary to exercise doublethink
for by use the word one admit that one be tamper with reality by a fresh act of doublethink one erase this knowledge and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth
ultimately it be by means of doublethink that the party have be able and may for all we know continue to be able for thousand of year to arrest the course of history
all past oligarchy have fall from power either because they ossify or because they grow soft
either they become stupid and arrogant fail to adjust themselves to changing circumstance and be overthrow or they become liberal and cowardly make concession when they shall have use force and once again be overthrow
they fall that be to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness
it be the achievement of the party to have produce a system of thought in which both condition can exist simultaneously
and upon no other intellectual basis can the dominion of the party be make permanent
if one be to rule and to continue rule one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality
for the secret of rulership be to combine a belief in one have own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistake
it need hardly be say that the subtle practitioner of doublethink be those who invent doublethink and know that it be a vast system of mental cheating
in our society those who have the good knowledge of what be happen be also those who be furthest from see the world as it be
in general the great the understanding the great the delusion the more intelligent the less sane
one clear illustration of this be the fact that war hysteria increase in intensity as one rise in the social scale
those whose attitude towards the war be most nearly rational be the subject people of the disputed territory
to these people the war be simply a continuous calamity which sweep to and fro over their body like a tidal wave
which side be win be a matter of complete indifference to them
they be aware that a change of overlordship mean simply that they will be do the same work as before for new master who treat them in the same manner as the old one
the slightly more favoured worker whom we call the prole be only intermittently conscious of the war
when it be necessary they can be prod into frenzy of fear and hatred but when leave to themselves they be capable of forget for long period that the war be happen
it be in the rank of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm be found
world-conquest be believe in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible
this peculiar linking-together of opposite knowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticism be one of the chief distinguishing mark of oceanic society
the official ideology abound with contradiction even when there be no practical reason for them
thus the party reject and vilify every principle for which the socialist movement originally stand and it choose to do this in the name of socialism
it preach a contempt for the working class unexampled for century past and it dress its member in a uniform which be at one time peculiar to manual worker and be adopt for that reason
it systematically undermine the solidarity of the family and it call its leader by a name which be a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty
even the name of the four Ministries by which we be govern exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the fact
the ministry of peace concern itself with war the ministry of truth with lie the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation
these contradiction be not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they be deliberate exercise in doublethink
for it be only by reconcile contradiction that power can be retain indefinitely
in no other way can the ancient cycle be break
if human equality be to be for ever avert if the high as we have call them be to keep their place permanently then the prevail mental condition must be control insanity
but there be one question which until this moment we have almost ignore
it be why shall human equality be avert
supposing that the mechanics of the process have be rightly describe what be the motive for this huge accurately plan effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time
here we reach the central secret
as we have see the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depend upon doublethink
but deep than this lie the original motive the never-questioned instinct that first lead to the seizure of power and bring doublethink the thought police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards
this motive really consist
Winston become aware of silence as one become aware of a new sound
it seem to him that julia have be very still for some time past
she be lie on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillow on her hand and one dark lock tumble across her eye
her breast rise and fall slowly and regularly
julia
no answer
julia be you awake
no answer
she be asleep
he shut the book put it carefully on the floor lie down and pull the coverlet over both of them
he have still he reflect not learn the ultimate secret
he understand how he do not understand why
chapter I like chapter III have not actually tell him anything that he do not know it have merely systematize the knowledge that he possess already
but after read it he know better than before that he be not mad
be in a minority even a minority of one do not make you mad
there be truth and there be untruth and if you cling to the truth even against the whole world you be not mad
a yellow beam from the sink sun slant in through the window and fall across the pillow
he shut his eye
the sun on his face and the girl have smooth body touch his own give him a strong sleepy confident feeling
he be safe everything be all right
he fall asleep murmur sanity be not statistical with the feeling that this remark contain in it a profound wisdom
when he wake it be with the sensation of have sleep for a long time but a glance at the old-fashioned clock tell him that it be only twenty-thirty
he lie doze for a while then the usual deep-lunged singing strike up from the yard below
it be only a hopeless fancy
it pass like a Ipril dye
but a look and a word and the dream they stir
they have steal my heart awye
the driveling song seem to have keep its popularity
you still hear it all over the place
it have outlive the hate song
julia wake at the sound stretch herself luxuriously and get out of bed
I be hungry she say
let 's make some more coffee
damn
the stove have go out and the water be cold
she pick the stove up and shake it
there be no oil in it
we can get some from old charrington I expect
the funny thing be I make sure it be full
I be go to put my clothes on she add
it seem to have get cold
Winston also get up and dress himself
the indefatigable voice sing on
they sye that time heal all thing
they sye you can always forget
but the smile and the tear acrorss the year
they twist my heart-string yet
as he fasten the belt of his overall he stroll across to the window
the sun must have go down behind the house it be not shine into the yard any longer
the flagstone be wet as though they have just be wash and he have the feeling that the sky have be wash too so fresh and pale be the blue between the chimney-pots
tirelessly the woman march to and fro cork and uncork herself sing and fall silent and peg out more diaper and more and yet more
he wonder whether she take in washing for a living or be merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchild
julia have come across to his side together they gaze down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below
as he look at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arm reach up for the line her powerful mare-like buttock protrude it strike him for the first time that she be beautiful
it have never before occur to him that the body of a woman of fifty blow up to monstrous dimension by childbearing then harden roughen by work till it be coarse in the grain like a over-ripe turnip can be beautiful
but it be so and after all he think why not
the solid contourless body like a block of granite and the rasping red skin bear the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose
why shall the fruit be hold inferior to the flower
she be beautiful he murmur
she be a metre across the hip easily say julia
that be her style of beauty say Winston
he hold julia have supple waist easily encircle by his arm
from the hip to the knee her flank be against his
out of their body no child will ever come
that be the one thing they can never do
only by word of mouth from mind to mind can they pass on the secret
the woman down there have no mind she have only strong arm a warm heart and a fertile belly
he wonder how many child she have give birth to
it must easily be fifteen
she have have her momentary flower a year perhaps of wild-rose beauty and then she have suddenly swollen like a fertilize fruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then her life have be launder scrub darn cooking sweep polish mending scrub launder first for child then for grandchild over thirty unbroken year
at the end of it she be still sing
the mystical reverence that he feel for her be somehow mix up with the aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretch away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance
it be curious to think that the sky be the same for everybody in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here
and the people under the sky be also very much the same everywhere all over the world hundred of thousand of million of people just like this people ignorant of one another have existence hold apart by wall of hatred and lie and yet almost exactly the same people who have never learn to think but who be store up in their heart and belly and muscle the power that will one day overturn the world
if there be hope it lie in the prole
without have read to the end of the book he know that that must be Goldstein have final message
the future belong to the prole
and can he be sure that when their time come the world they construct will not be just as alien to him Winston Smith as the world of the party
yes because at the least it will be a world of sanity
where there be equality there can be sanity
sooner or later it will happen strength will change into consciousness
the prole be immortal you can not doubt it when you look at that valiant figure in the yard
in the end their awakening will come
and until that happen though it must be a thousand year they will stay alive against all the odds like bird pass on from body to body the vitality which the party do not share and can not kill
do you remember he say the thrush that sing to us that first day at the edge of the wood
he be+not sing to us say julia
he be sing to please himself
not even that
he be just sing
the bird sing the prole sing the party do not sing
all round the world in London and new York in Africa and Brazil and in the mysterious forbidden land beyond the frontier in the street of Paris and Berlin in the village of the endless Russian plain in the bazaar of China and Japan everywhere stand the same solid unconquerable figure make monstrous by work and childbearing toil from birth to death and still sing
out of those mighty loin a race of conscious being must one day come
you be the dead theirs be the future
but you can share in that future if you keep alive the mind as they keep alive the body and pass on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four
we be the dead he say
we be the dead echo julia dutiful
you be the dead say a iron voice behind them
they spring apart
Winston have entrails seem to have turn into ice
he can see the white all round the iris of julia have eye
her face have turn a milky yellow
the smear of rouge that be still on each cheekbone stand out sharply almost as though unconnect with the skin beneath
you be the dead repeat the iron voice
it be behind the picture breathe julia
it be behind the picture say the voice
remain exactly where you be
make no movement until you be order
it be start it be start at last
they can do nothing except stand gaze into one another have eye
to run for life to get out of the house before it be too late no such thought occur to them
unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall
there be a snap as though a catch have be turn back and a crash of break glass
the picture have fall to the floor uncover the telescreen behind it
now they can see us say julia
now we can see you say the voice
stand out in the middle of the room
stand back to back
clasp your hand behind your head
do not touch one another
they be not touch but it seem to him that he can feel julia have body shake
or perhaps it be merely the shake of his own
he can just stop his tooth from chatter but his knee be beyond his control
there be a sound of trample boot below inside the house and outside
the yard seem to be full of man
something be be drag across the stone
the woman have singing have stop abruptly
there be a long rolling clang as though the washtub have be fling across the yard and then a confusion of angry shout which end in a yell of pain
the house be surround say Winston
the house be surround say the voice
he hear julia snap her tooth together
I suppose we may as well say good-bye she say
you may as well say good-bye say the voice
and then another quite different voice a thin cultivated voice which Winston have the impression of have hear before strike in and by the way while we be on the subject here come a candle to light you to bed here come a chopper to chop off your head
something crash on to the bed behind Winston have back
the head of a ladder have be thrust through the window and have burst in the frame
someone be climb through the window
there be a stampede of boot up the stair
the room be full of solid man in black uniform with iron-shod boot on their foot and truncheon in their hand
Winston be not tremble any longer
even his eye he barely move
one thing alone matter to keep still to keep still and not give them a excuse to hit you
a man with a smooth prizefighter have jowl in which the mouth be only a slit pause opposite him balance his truncheon meditative between thumb and forefinger
Winston meet his eye
the feeling of nakedness with one have hand behind one have head and one have face and body all expose be almost unbearable
the man protrude the tip of a white tongue lick the place where his lip shall have be and then pass on
there be another crash
someone have pick up the glass paperweight from the table and smash it to piece on the hearth-stone
the fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake roll across the mat
how small think Winston how small it always be
there be a gasp and a thump behind him and he receive a violent kick on the ankle which nearly fling him off his balance
one of the man have smash his fist into julia have solar plexus double her up like a pocket ruler
she be thrash about on the floor fight for breath
Winston dare not turn his head even by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasp face come within the angle of his vision
even in his terror it be as though he can feel the pain in his own body the deadly pain which nevertheless be less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath
he know what it be like the terrible agonizing pain which be there all the while but can not be suffer yet because before all else it be necessary to be able to breathe
then two of the man hoist her up by knee and shoulder and carry her out of the room like a sack
Winston have a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the eye shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek and that be the last he see of her
he stand dead still
no one have hit him yet
thought which come of their own accord but seem totally uninteresting begin to flit through his mind
he wonder whether they have get Mister charrington
he wonder what they have do to the woman in the yard
he notice that he badly want to urinate and feel a faint surprise because he have do so only two or three hour ago
he notice that the clock on the mantelpiece say nine mean twenty-one
but the light seem too strong
will not the light be fade at twenty-one hour on a August evening
he wonder whether after all he and julia have mistaken the time have sleep the clock round and think it be twenty-thirty when really it be nought eight-thirty on the following morning
but he do not pursue the thought further
it be not interesting
there be another light step in the passage
Mister charrington come into the room
the demeanour of the black-uniformed man suddenly become more subdued
something have also change in Mister charrington have appearance
his eye fall on the fragment of the glass paperweight
pick up those piece he say sharply
a man stoop to obey
the cockney accent have disappear Winston suddenly realize whose voice it be that he have hear a few moment ago on the telescreen
Mister charrington be still wear his old velvet jacket but his hair which have be almost white have turn black
also he be not wear his spectacle
he give Winston a single sharp glance as though verify his identity and then pay no more attention to him
he be still recognizable but he be not the same person any longer
his body have straighten and seem to have grow big
his face have undergo only tiny change that have nevertheless work a complete transformation
the black eyebrow be less bushy the wrinkle be go the whole line of the face seem to have alter even the nose seem short
it be the alert cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty
it occur to Winston that for the first time in his life he be look with knowledge at a member of the thought police
he do not know where he be
presumably he be in the ministry of love but there be no way of make certain
he be in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with wall of glitter white porcelain
concealed lamp flood it with cold light and there be a low steady hum sound which he suppose have something to do with the air supply
a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on run round the wall break only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat
there be four telescreen one in each wall
there be a dull ache in his belly
it have be there ever since they have bundle him into the closed van and drive him away
but he be also hungry with a gnaw unwholesome kind of hunger
it must be twenty-four hour since he have eat it must be thirty-six
he still do not know probably never will know whether it have be morning or evening when they arrest him
since he be arrest he have not be feed
he sit as still as he can on the narrow bench with his hand cross on his knee
he have already learn to sit still
if you make unexpected movement they yell at you from the telescreen
but the crave for food be grow upon him
what he long for above all be a piece of bread
he have a idea that there be a few breadcrumb in the pocket of his overall
it be even possible he think this because from time to time something seem to tickle his leg that there must be a sizeable bit of crust there
in the end the temptation to find out overcome his fear he slip a hand into his pocket
Smith yell a voice from the telescreen 6079 Smith Winston
hand out of pocket in the cell
he sit still again his hand cross on his knee
before be bring here he have be take to another place which must have be a ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up use by the patrol
he do not know how long he have be there some hour at any rate with no clock and no daylight it be hard to gauge the time
it be a noisy evil-smelling place
they have put him into a cell similar to the one he be now in but filthily dirty and at all time crowd by ten or fifteen people
the majority of them be common criminal but there be a few political prisoner among them
he have sit silent against the wall jostle by dirty body too preoccupy by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings but still notice the astonishing difference in demeanour between the party prisoner and the others
the party prisoner be always silent and terrified but the ordinary criminal seem to care nothing for anybody
they yell insult at the guard fight back fiercely when their belonging be impound write obscene word on the floor eat smuggle food which they produce from mysterious hiding-place in their clothes and even shout down the telescreen when it try to restore order
on the other hand some of them seem to be on good term with the guard call them by nickname and try to wheedle cigarette through the spyhole in the door
the guard too treat the common criminal with a certain forbearance even when they have to handle them roughly
there be much talk about the forced-labour camp to which most of the prisoner expect to be sent
it be all right in the camp he gather so long as you have good contact and know the rope
there be bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there be homosexuality and prostitution there be even illicit alcohol distil from potato
the position of trust be give only to the common criminal especially the gangster and the murderer who form a sort of aristocracy
all the dirty job be do by the political
there be a constant come-and-go of prisoner of every description drug-peddlers thief bandit black-marketeer drunk prostitute
some of the drunk be so violent that the other prisoner have to combine to suppress them
a enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumble breast and thick coil of white hair which have come down in her struggle be carry in kick and shout by four guard who have hold of her one at each corner
they wrench off the boot with which she have be try to kick them and dump her down across Winston have lap almost break his thigh-bone
the woman hoist herself upright and follow them out with a yell of F bastard
then notice that she be sit on something uneven she slide off Winston have knee on to the bench
beg pardon dearie she say
I would+not 'a sit on you only the bugger put me there
they dono 'ow to treat a lady do they
she pause pat her breast and belch
pardon she say I be+not meself quite
she leant forward and vomit copiously on the floor
that+be good she say lean back with closed eye
never keep it down that+be what I say
get it up while it be fresh on your stomach like
she revive turn to have another look at Winston and seem immediately to take a fancy to him
she put a vast arm round his shoulder and draw him towards her breathe beer and vomit into his face
be your name dearie
she say
Smith say Winston
Smith
say the woman
that+be funny
my name be Smith too
why she add sentimentally I must be your mother
she must think Winston be his mother
she be about the right age and physique and it be probable that people change somewhat after twenty year in a forced-labour camp
no one else have speak to him
to a surprising extent the ordinary criminal ignore the party prisoner
the polits they call them with a sort of uninterested contempt
the party prisoner seem terrify of speak to anybody and above all of speak to one another
only once when two party member both woman be press close together on the bench he overhear amid the din of voice a few hurriedly-whispered word and in particular a reference to something call room one-oh-one which he do not understand
it must be two or three hour ago that they have bring him here
the dull pain in his belly never go away but sometimes it grow good and sometimes bad and his thought expand or contract accordingly
when it grow bad he think only of the pain itself and of his desire for food
when it grow good panic take hold of him
there be moment when he foresee the thing that will happen to him with such actuality that his heart gallop and his breath stop
he feel the smash of truncheon on his elbow and iron-shod boot on his shin he see himself grovel on the floor scream for mercy through broken tooth
he hardly think of julia
he can not fix his mind on her
he love her and will not betray her but that be only a fact know as he know the rule of arithmetic
he feel no love for her and he hardly even wonder what be happen to her
he think often of O'Brien with a flicker hope
O'Brien must know that he have be arrest
the brotherhood he have say never try to save its member
but there be the razor blade they will sent the razor blade if they can
there will be perhaps five second before the guard can rush into the cell
the blade will bite into him with a sort of burning coldness and even the finger that hold it will be cut to the bone
everything come back to his sick body which shrink tremble from the small pain
he be not certain that he will use the razor blade even if he get the chance
it be more natural to exist from moment to moment accept another ten minute have life even with the certainty that there be torture at the end of it
sometimes he try to calculate the number of porcelain brick in the wall of the cell
it shall have be easy but he always lose count at some point or another
more often he wonder where he be and what time of day it be
at one moment he feel certain that it be broad daylight outside and at the next equally certain that it be pitch darkness
in this place he know instinctively the light will never be turn out
it be the place with no darkness he see now why O'Brien have seem to recognize the allusion
in the ministry of love there be no window
his cell must be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall it must be ten floor below ground or thirty above it
he move himself mentally from place to place and try to determine by the feeling of his body whether he be perch high in the air or bury deep underground
there be a sound of march boot outside
the steel door open with a clang
a young officer a trim black-uniformed figure who seem to glitter all over with polished leather and whose pale straight-featured face be like a wax mask step smartly through the doorway
he motion to the guard outside to bring in the prisoner they be lead
the poet ampleforth shamble into the cell
the door clang shut again
ampleforth make one or two uncertain movement from side to side as though have some idea that there be another door to go out of and then begin to wander up and down the cell
he have not yet notice Winston have presence
his troubled eye be gaze at the wall about a metre above the level of Winston have head
he be shoeless large dirty toe be stick out of the hole in his sock
he be also several day away from a shave
a scrubby beard cover his face to the cheekbone give him a air of ruffianism that go oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movement
Winston rouse himself a little from his lethargy
he must speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen
it be even conceivable that ampleforth be the bearer of the razor blade
ampleforth he say
there be no yell from the telescreen
ampleforth pause mildly startle
his eye focus themselves slowly on Winston
ah Smith he say
you too
what be you in for
to tell you the truth he sit down awkwardly on the bench opposite Winston
there be only one offence be there not
he say
and have you commit it
apparently I have
he put a hand to his forehead and press his temple for a moment as though try to remember something
these thing happen he begin vague
I have be able to recall one instance a possible instance
it be a indiscretion undoubtedly
we be produce a definitive edition of the poem of kipling
I allow the word god to remain at the end of a line
I can not help it he add almost indignantly raise his face to look at Winston
it be impossible to change the line
the rhyme be rod
do you realize that there be only twelve rhyme to rod in the entire language
for day I have rack my brain
there be no other rhyme
the expression on his face change
the annoyance pass out of it and for a moment he look almost pleased
a sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who have find out some useless fact shone through the dirt and scrubby hair
have it ever occur to you he say that the whole history of English poetry have be determine by the fact that the English language lack rhyme
no that particular thought have never occur to Winston
nor in the circumstance do it strike him as very important or interesting
do you know what time of day it be
he say
ampleforth look startle again
I have hardly think about it
they arrest me it can be two day ago perhaps three
his eye flit round the wall as though he half expect to find a window somewhere
there be no difference between night and day in this place
I do not see how one can calculate the time
they talk desultorily for some minute then without apparent reason a yell from the telescreen bid them be silent
Winston sit quietly his hand cross
ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidget from side to side clasp his lank hand first round one knee then round the other
the telescreen bark at him to keep still
time pass
twenty minute a hour it be difficult to judge
once more there be a sound of boot outside
Winston have entrails contract
soon very soon perhaps in five minute perhaps now the tramp of boot will mean that his own turn have come
the door open
the cold-faced young officer step into the cell
with a brief movement of the hand he indicate ampleforth
room 101 he say
ampleforth march clumsily out between the guard his face vague perturb but uncomprehend
what seem like a long time pass
the pain in Winston have belly have revive
his mind sag round and round on the same trick like a ball fall again and again into the same series of slot
he have only six thought
the pain in his belly a piece of bread the blood and the scream O'Brien julia the razor blade
there be another spasm in his entrails the heavy boot be approach
as the door open the wave of air that it create bring in a powerful smell of cold sweat
Parsons walk into the cell
he be wear khaki short and a sports-shirt
this time Winston be startle into self-forgetfulness
you here he say
Parsons give Winston a glance in which there be neither interest nor surprise but only misery
he begin walk jerkily up and down evidently unable to keep still
each time he straighten his pudgy knee it be apparent that they be tremble
his eye have a wide-open staring look as though he can not prevent himself from gaze at something in the middle distance
what be you in for
say Winston
thoughtcrime say Parsons almost blubber
the tone of his voice imply at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word can be apply to himself
he pause opposite Winston and begin eagerly appeal to him you do+not think they will shoot me do you old chap
they do+not shoot you if you have+not actually do anything only thought which you can+not help
I know they give you a fair hearing
oh I trust them for that
they will know my record will+not they
you know what kind of chap I be
not a bad chap in my way
not brainy of course but keen
I try to do my best for the party do+not I
I will get off with five year do+not you think
or even ten year
a chap like me can make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp
they would+not shoot me for go off the rail just once
be you guilty
say Winston
of course I be guilty cry Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen
you do+not think the party will arrest a innocent man do you
his frog-like face grow calm and even take on a slightly sanctimonious expression
thoughtcrime be a dreadful thing old man he say sententious
it be insidious
it can get hold of you without your even know it
do you know how it get hold of me
in my sleep
yes that be a fact
there I be work away try to do my bit never know I have any bad stuff in my mind at all
and then I start talk in my sleep
do you know what they hear me say
he sink his voice like someone who be obliged for medical reason to utter a obscenity
down with big brother
yes I say that
say it over and over again it seem
between you and me old man I be glad they get me before it go any further
do you know what I be go to say to them when I go up before the tribunal
thank you I be go to say thank you for save me before it be too late
who denounce you
say Winston
it be my little daughter say Parsons with a sort of doleful pride
she listen at the keyhole
hear what I be say and nip off to the patrol the very next day
pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh
I do+not bear her any grudge for it
in fact I be proud of her
it show I bring her up in the right spirit anyway
he make a few more jerky movement up and down several time cast a longing glance at the lavatory pan
then he suddenly rip down his short
excuse me old man he say
I can+not help it
it be the wait
he plump his large posterior into the lavatory pan
Winston cover his face with his hand
Smith yell the voice from the telescreen 6079 Smith w
uncover your face
no face cover in the cell
Winston uncover his face
Parsons use the lavatory loudly and abundantly
it then turn out that the plug be defective and the cell stink abominably for hour afterwards
Parsons be remove
more prisoner come and go mysteriously
one a woman be consign to room 101 and Winston notice seem to shrivel and turn a different colour when she hear the word
a time come when if it have be morning when he be bring here it will be afternoon or if it have be afternoon then it will be midnight
there be six prisoner in the cell man and woman
all sit very still
opposite Winston there sit a man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent
his fat mottled cheek be so pouched at the bottom that it be difficult not to believe that he have little store of food tuck away there
his pale-grey eye flit timorous from face to face and turn quickly away again when he catch anyone have eye
the door open and another prisoner be bring in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston
he be a commonplace mean-looking man who must have be a engineer or technician of some kind
but what be startling be the emaciation of his face
it be like a skull
because of its thinness the mouth and eye look disproportionately large and the eye seem fill with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something
the man sit down on the bench at a little distance from Winston
Winston do not look at him again but the torment skull-like face be as vivid in his mind as though it have be straight in front of his eye
suddenly he realize what be the matter
the man be die of starvation
the same thought seem to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell
there be a very faint stir all the way round the bench
the eye of the chinless man keep flit towards the skull-faced man then turn guiltily away then be drag back by a irresistible attraction
presently he begin to fidget on his seat
at last he stand up waddle clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocket of his overall and with a abashed air hold out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man
there be a furious deafening roar from the telescreen
the chinless man jump in his track
the skull-faced man have quickly thrust his hand behind his back as though demonstrate to all the world that he refuse the gift
bumstead roar the voice 2713 bumstead J.
let fall that piece of bread
the chinless man drop the piece of bread on the floor
remain stand where you be say the voice
face the door
make no movement
the chinless man obey
his large pouchy cheek be quiver uncontrollably
the door clang open
as the young officer enter and step aside there emerge from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arm and shoulder
he take his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of his body behind it full in the chinless man have mouth
the force of it seem almost to knock him clear of the floor
his body be fling across the cell and fetch up against the base of the lavatory seat
for a moment he lie as though stun with dark blood ooze from his mouth and nose
a very faint whimper or squeak which seem unconscious come out of him
then he roll over and raise himself unsteadily on hand and knee
amid a stream of blood and saliva the two half of a dental plate fall out of his mouth
the prisoner sit very still their hand cross on their knee
the chinless man climb back into his place
down one side of his face the flesh be darken
his mouth have swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it
from time to time a little blood drip on to the breast of his overall
his grey eye still flit from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he be try to discover how much the others despise him for his humiliation
the door open
with a small gesture the officer indicate the skull-faced man
room 101 he say
there be a gasp and a flurry at Winston have side
the man have actually fling himself on his knee on the floor with his hand clasp together
comrade
officer he cry
you do+not have to take me to that place
have+not I tell you everything already
what else be it you want to know
there be nothing I would+not confess nothing
just tell me what it be and I will confess straight off
write it down and I will sign it anything
not room 101
room 101 say the officer
the man have face already very pale turn a colour Winston will not have believe possible
it be definitely unmistakably a shade of green
do anything to me he yell
you have be starve me for week
finish it off and let me die
shoot me
hang me
sentence me to twenty-five year
be there somebody else you want me to give away
just say who it be and I will tell you anything you want
I do+not care who it be or what you do to them
I have get a wife and three child
the big of them be+not six year old
you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throat in front of my eye and I will stand by and watch it
but not room 101
room 101 say the officer
the man look frantically round at the other prisoner as though with some idea that he can put another victim in his own place
his eye settle on the smash face of the chinless man
he fling out a lean arm
that be the one you ought to be take not me he shout
you do+not hear what he be say after they bash his face
give me a chance and I will tell you every word of it
he be the one that be against the party not me
the guard step forward
the man have voice rise to a shriek
you do+not hear him he repeat
something go wrong with the telescreen
he be the one you want
take him not me
the two sturdy guard have stoop to take him by the arm
but just at this moment he fling himself across the floor of the cell and grab one of the iron leg that support the bench
he have set up a wordless howl like a animal
the guard take hold of him to wrench him loose but he cling on with astonishing strength
for perhaps twenty second they be haul at him
the prisoner sit quiet their hand cross on their knee look straight in front of them
the howl stop the man have no breath leave for anything except hang on
then there be a different kind of cry
a kick from a guard have boot have broken the finger of one of his hand
they drag him to his foot
room 101 say the officer
the man be lead out walk unsteadily with head sunken nurse his crush hand all the fight have go out of him
a long time pass
if it have be midnight when the skull-faced man be take away it be morning if morning it be afternoon
Winston be alone and have be alone for hour
the pain of sit on the narrow bench be such that often he get up and walk about unreproved by the telescreen
the piece of bread still lie where the chinless man have drop it
at the beginning it need a hard effort not to look at it but presently hunger give way to thirst
his mouth be sticky and evil-tasting
the hum sound and the unvarying white light induce a sort of faintness a empty feeling inside his head
he will get up because the ache in his bone be no longer bearable and then will sit down again almost at once because he be too dizzy to make sure of stay on his foot
whenever his physical sensation be a little under control the terror return
sometimes with a fade hope he think of O'Brien and the razor blade
it be thinkable that the razor blade must arrive conceal in his food if he be ever feed
more dimly he think of julia
somewhere or other she be suffer perhaps far worse than he
she must be scream with pain at this moment
he think if I can save julia by double my own pain will I do it
yes I will
but that be merely a intellectual decision take because he know that he ought to take it
he do not feel it
in this place you can not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain
besides be it possible when you be actually suffer it to wish for any reason that your own pain shall increase
but that question be not answerable yet
the boot be approach again
the door open
O'Brien come in
Winston start to his foot
the shock of the sight have drive all caution out of him
for the first time in many year he forget the presence of the telescreen
they have get you too he cry
they get me a long time ago say O'Brien with a mild almost regretful irony
he step aside
from behind him there emerge a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand
you know him Winston say O'Brien
do+not deceive yourself
you do know it you have always know it
yes he see now he have always know it
but there be no time to think of that
all he have eye for be the truncheon in the guard have hand
it must fall anywhere on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow
the elbow
he have slump to his knee almost paralyse clasp the stricken elbow with his other hand
everything have explode into yellow light
inconceivable inconceivable that one blow can cause such pain
the light clear and he can see the other two look down at him
the guard be laugh at his contortion
one question at any rate be answer
never for any reason on earth can you wish for a increase of pain
of pain you can wish only one thing that it shall stop
nothing in the world be so bad as physical pain
in the face of pain there be no hero no hero he think over and over as he writhe on the floor clutch uselessly at his disabled left arm
he be lie on something that feel like a camp bed except that it be high off the ground and that he be fix down in some way so that he can not move
light that seem strong than usual be fall on his face
O'Brien be stand at his side look down at him intently
at the other side of him stand a man in a white coat hold a hypodermic syringe
even after his eye be open he take in his surroundings only gradually
he have the impression of swim up into this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath it
how long he have be down there he do not know
since the moment when they arrest him he have not see darkness or daylight
besides his memory be not continuous
there have be time when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one have in sleep have stop dead and start again after a blank interval
but whether the interval be of day or week or only second there be no way of know
with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare have start
later he be to realize that all that then happen be merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoner be subject
there be a long range of crime espionage sabotage and the like to which everyone have to confess as a matter of course
the confession be a formality though the torture be real
how many time he have be beat how long the beating have continue he can not remember
always there be five or six man in black uniform at him simultaneously
sometimes it be fist sometimes it be truncheon sometimes it be steel rod sometimes it be boot
there be time when he roll about the floor as shameless as a animal writhe his body this way and that in a endless hopeless effort to dodge the kick and simply invite more and yet more kick in his rib in his belly on his elbow on his shin in his groin in his testicle on the bone at the base of his spine
there be time when it go on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seem to him not that the guard continue to beat him but that he can not force himself into lose consciousness
there be time when his nerve so forsake him that he begin shout for mercy even before the beating begin when the mere sight of a fist draw back for a blow be enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crime
there be other time when he start out with the resolve of confess nothing when every word have to be force out of him between gasp of pain and there be time when he feebly try to compromise when he say to himself I will confess but not yet
I must hold out till the pain become unbearable
three more kick two more kick and then I will tell them what they want
sometimes he be beaten till he can hardly stand then fling like a sack of potato on to the stone floor of a cell leave to recuperate for a few hour and then take out and beat again
there be also long period of recovery
he remember them dimly because they be spend chiefly in sleep or stupor
he remember a cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf stick out from the wall and a tin wash-basin and meal of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee
he remember a surly barber arrive to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslike unsympathetic man in white coat feel his pulse tap his reflex turn up his eyelid run harsh finger over him in search for broken bone and shoot needle into his arm to make him sleep
the beating grow less frequent and become mainly a threat a horror to which he can be sent back at any moment when his answer be unsatisfactory
his questioners now be not ruffian in black uniform but party intellectual little rotund man with quick movement and flash spectacle who work on him in relay over period which last he think he can not be sure ten or twelve hour at a stretch
these other questioners see to it that he be in constant slight pain but it be not chiefly pain that they rely on
they slap his face wrung his ear pull his hair make him stand on one leg refuse him leave to urinate shone glaring light in his face until his eye run with water but the aim of this be simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of argue and reason
their real weapon be the merciless questioning that go on and on hour after hour trip him up lay trap for him twist everything that he say convict him at every step of lie and self-contradiction until he begin weep as much from shame as from nervous fatigue sometimes he will weep half a dozen time in a single session
most of the time they scream abuse at him and threaten at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guard again but sometimes they will suddenly change their tune call him comrade appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and big brother and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he have not enough loyalty to the party leave to make him wish to undo the evil he have do
when his nerve be in rag after hour of questioning even this appeal can reduce him to snivelling tear
in the end the nagging voice break him down more completely than the boot and fist of the guard
he become simply a mouth that utter a hand that sign whatever be demand of him
his sole concern be to find out what they want him to confess and then confess it quickly before the bullying start anew
he confess to the assassination of eminent party member the distribution of seditious pamphlet embezzlement of public fund sale of military secret sabotage of every kind
he confess that he have be a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as 1968
he confess that he be a religious believer a admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert
he confess that he have murder his wife although he know and his questioners must have know that his wife be still alive
he confess that for year he have be in personal touch with Goldstein and have be a member of a underground organization which have include almost every human being he have ever know
it be easy to confess everything and implicate everybody
besides in a sense it be all true
it be true that he have be the enemy of the party and in the eye of the party there be no distinction between the thought and the deed
there be also memory of another kind
they stand out in his mind disconnectedly like picture with blackness all round them
he be in a cell which must have be either dark or light because he can see nothing except a pair of eye
near at hand some kind of instrument be tick slowly and regularly
the eye grow large and more luminous
suddenly he float out of his seat dive into the eye and be swallow up
he be strap into a chair surround by dial under dazzle light
a man in a white coat be read the dial
there be a tramp of heavy boot outside
the door clang open
the waxed-faced officer march in follow by two guard
room 101 say the officer
the man in the white coat do not turn round
he do not look at Winston either he be look only at the dial
he be roll down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious golden light roar with laughter and shout out confession at the top of his voice
he be confess everything even the thing he have succeed in hold back under the torture
he be relate the entire history of his life to a audience who know it already
with him be the guard the other questioners the man in white coat O'Brien julia Mister charrington all roll down the corridor together and shout with laughter
some dreadful thing which have lie embed in the future have somehow be skip over and have not happen
everything be all right there be no more pain the last detail of his life be lay bare understand forgive
he be start up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he have hear O'Brien have voice
all through his interrogation although he have never see him he have have the feeling that O'Brien be at his elbow just out of sight
it be O'Brien who be direct everything
it be he who set the guard on to Winston and who prevent them from kill him
it be he who decide when Winston shall scream with pain when he shall have a respite when he shall be feed when he shall sleep when the drug shall be pump into his arm
it be he who ask the question and suggest the answer
he be the tormentor he be the protector he be the inquisitor he be the friend
and once Winston can not remember whether it be in druged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulness a voice murmur in his ear do+not worry Winston you be in my keeping
for seven year I have watch over you
now the turning-point have come
I shall save you I shall make you perfect
he be not sure whether it be O'Brien have voice but it be the same voice that have say to him we shall meet in the place where there be no darkness in that other dream seven year ago
he do not remember any ending to his interrogation
there be a period of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now be have gradually materialize round him
he be almost flat on his back and unable to move
his body be hold down at every essential point
even the back of his head be grip in some manner
O'Brien be look down at him gravely and rather sadly
his face see from below look coarse and wear with pouch under the eye and tired line from nose to chin
he be old than Winston have think him he be perhaps forty-eight or fifty
under his hand there be a dial with a lever on top and figure run round the face
I tell you say O'Brien that if we meet again it will be here
yes say Winston
without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien have hand a wave of pain flood his body
it be a frightening pain because he can not see what be happen and he have the feeling that some mortal injury be be do to him
he do not know whether the thing be really happen or whether the effect be electrically produce but his body be be wrench out of shape the joint be be slowly tear apart
although the pain have bring the sweat out on his forehead the bad of all be the fear that his backbone be about to snap
he set his tooth and breathe hard through his nose try to keep silent as long as possible
you be afraid say O'Brien watch his face that in another moment something be go to break
your especial fear be that it will be your backbone
you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebra snap apart and the spinal fluid drip out of them
that be what you be think be it not Winston
Winston do not answer
O'Brien draw back the lever on the dial
the wave of pain recede almost as quickly as it have come
that be forty say O'Brien
you can see that the number on this dial run up to a hundred
will you please remember throughout our conversation that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree I choose
if you tell me any lie or attempt to prevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual level of intelligence you will cry out with pain instantly
do you understand that
yes say Winston
O'Brien have manner become less severe
he resettle his spectacle thoughtfully and take a pace or two up and down
when he speak his voice be gentle and patient
he have the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish
I be take trouble with you Winston he say because you be worth trouble
you know perfectly well what be the mat with you
you have know it for year though you have fight against the knowledge
you be mentally deranged
you suffer from a defective memory
you be unable to remember real event and you persuade yourself that you remember other event which never happen
fortunately it be curable
you have never cure yourself of it because you do not choose to
there be a small effort of the will that you be not ready to make
even now I be well aware you be cling to your disease under the impression that it be a virtue
now we will take a example
at this moment which power be Oceania at war with
when I be arrest Oceania be at war with Eastasia
with Eastasia
good
and Oceania have always be at war with Eastasia have it not
Winston draw in his breath
he open his mouth to speak and then do not speak
he can not take his eye away from the dial
the truth please Winston
your truth
tell me what you think you remember
I remember that until only a week before I be arrest we be not at war with Eastasia at all
we be in alliance with them
the war be against Eurasia
that have last for four year
before that
O'Brien stop him with a movement of the hand
another example he say
some year ago you have a very serious delusion indeed
you believe that three man three one-time party member name jones aaronson and rutherford man who be execute for treachery and sabotage after make the full possible confession be not guilty of the crime they be charge with
you believe that you have see unmistakable documentary evidence prove that their confession be false
there be a certain photograph about which you have a hallucination
you believe that you have actually hold it in your hand
it be a photograph something like this
a oblong slip of newspaper have appear between O'Brien have finger
for perhaps five second it be within the angle of Winston have vision
it be a photograph and there be no question of its identity
it be the photograph
it be another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson and rutherford at the party function in new York which he have chance upon eleven year ago and promptly destroy
for only a instant it be before his eye then it be out of sight again
but he have see it unquestionably he have see it
he make a desperate agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free
it be impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction
for the moment he have even forget the dial
all he want be to hold the photograph in his finger again or at least to see it
it exist he cry
no say O'Brien
he step across the room
there be a memory hole in the opposite wall
O'Brien lift the grating
unseen the frail slip of paper be whirl away on the current of warm air it be vanish in a flash of flame
O'Brien turn away from the wall
ash he say
not even identifiable ash
dust
it do not exist
it never exist
but it do exist
it do exist
it exist in memory
I remember it
you remember it
I do not remember it say O'Brien
Winston have heart sink
that be doublethink
he have a feeling of deadly helplessness
if he can have be certain that O'Brien be lie it will not have seem to matter
but it be perfectly possible that O'Brien have really forget the photograph
and if so then already he will have forget his denial of remember it and forget the act of forget
how can one be sure that it be simple trickery
perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind can really happen that be the thought that defeat him
O'Brien be look down at him speculatively
more than ever he have the air of a teacher take pain with a wayward but promising child
there be a party slogan deal with the control of the past he say
repeat it if you please
who control the past control the future who control the present control the past repeat Winston obediently
who control the present control the past say O'Brien nod his head with slow approval
be it your opinion Winston that the past have real existence
again the feeling of helplessness descend upon Winston
his eye flit towards the dial
he not only do not know whether yes or no be the answer that will save him from pain he do not even know which answer he believe to be the true one
O'Brien smile faintly
you be no metaphysician Winston he say
until this moment you have never consider what be mean by existence
I will put it more precisely
do the past exist concretely in space
be there somewhere or other a place a world of solid object where the past be still happen
no
then where do the past exist if at all
in record
it be write down
in record
and
in the mind
in human memory
in memory
Very well then
we the party control all record and we control all memory
then we control the past do we not
but how can you stop people remember thing
cry Winston again momentarily forget the dial
it be involuntary
it be outside oneself
how can you control memory
you have not control mine
O'Brien have manner grow stern again
he lay his hand on the dial
on the contrary he say you have not control it
that be what have bring you here
you be here because you have fail in humility in self-discipline
you will not make the act of submission which be the price of sanity
you prefer to be a lunatic a minority of one
only the discipline mind can see reality Winston
you believe that reality be something objective external exist in its own right
you also believe that the nature of reality be self-evident
when you delude yourself into think that you see something you assume that everyone else see the same thing as you
but I tell you Winston that reality be not external
reality exist in the human mind and nowhere else
not in the individual mind which can make mistake and in any case soon perish only in the mind of the party which be collective and immortal
whatever the party hold to be the truth be truth
it be impossible to see reality except by look through the eye of the party
that be the fact that you have get to relearn Winston
it need a act of self-destruction a effort of the will
you must humble yourself before you can become sane
he pause for a few moment as though to allow what he have be say to sink in
do you remember he go on write in your diary freedom be the freedom to say that two plus two make four
yes say Winston
O'Brien hold up his left hand its back towards Winston with the thumb hide and the four finger extend
how many finger be I hold up Winston
four
and if the party say that it be not four but five then how many
four
the word end in a gasp of pain
the needle of the dial have shoot up to fifty-five
the sweat have spring out all over Winston have body
the air tear into his lung and issue again in deep groan which even by clench his tooth he can not stop
O'Brien watch him the four finger still extend
he draw back the lever
this time the pain be only slightly ease
how many finger Winston
four
the needle go up to sixty
how many finger Winston
four
four
what else can I say
four
the needle must have rise again but he do not look at it
the heavy stern face and the four finger fill his vision
the finger stand up before his eye like pillar enormous blurry and seem to vibrate but unmistakably four
how many finger Winston
four
stop it stop it
how can you go on
four
four
how many finger Winston
five
five
five
no Winston that be no use
you be lie
you still think there be four
how many finger please
four
five
four
anything you like
only stop it stop the pain
abruptly he be sit up with O'Brien have arm round his shoulder
he have perhaps lose consciousness for a few second
the bond that have hold his body down be loosen
he feel very cold he be shake uncontrollably his tooth be chatter the tear be roll down his cheek
for a moment he cling to O'Brien like a baby curiously comfort by the heavy arm round his shoulder
he have the feeling that O'Brien be his protector that the pain be something that come from outside from some other source and that it be O'Brien who will save him from it
you be a slow learner Winston say O'Brien gently
how can I help it
he blubber
how can I help see what be in front of my eye
two and two be four
sometimes Winston
sometimes they be five
sometimes they be three
sometimes they be all of them at once
you must try hard
it be not easy to become sane
he lay Winston down on the bed
the grip of his limb tighten again but the pain have ebb away and the tremble have stop leave him merely weak and cold
O'Brien motion with his head to the man in the white coat who have stand immobile throughout the proceedings
the man in the white coat bend down and look closely into Winston have eye feel his pulse lay a ear against his chest tap here and there then he nod to O'Brien
again say O'Brien
the pain flow into Winston have body
the needle must be at seventy seventy-five
he have shut his eye this time
he know that the finger be still there and still four
all that matter be somehow to stay alive until the spasm be over
he have cease to notice whether he be cry out or not
the pain lessen again
he open his eye
O'Brien have draw back the lever
how many finger Winston
four
I suppose there be four
I will see five if I can
I be try to see five
which do you wish to persuade me that you see five or really to see them
really to see them
again say O'Brien
perhaps the needle be eighty ninety
Winston can not intermittently remember why the pain be happen
behind his screwed-up eyelid a forest of finger seem to be move in a sort of dance weave in and out disappear behind one another and reappear again
he be try to count them he can not remember why
he know only that it be impossible to count them and that this be somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four
the pain die down again
when he open his eye it be to find that he be still see the same thing
innumerable finger like moving tree be still stream past in either direction cross and recross
he shut his eye again
how many finger be I hold up Winston
I do+not know
I do+not know
you will kill me if you do that again
four five six in all honesty I do+not know
better say O'Brien
a needle slide into Winston have arm
almost in the same instant a blissful healing warmth spread all through his body
the pain be already half-forgotten
he open his eye and look up gratefully at O'Brien
at sight of the heavy line face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seem to turn over
if he can have move he will have stretch out a hand and lay it on O'Brien arm
he have never love him so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he have stop the pain
the old feeling that it bottom it do not matter whether O'Brien be a friend or a enemy have come back
O'Brien be a person who can be talk to
perhaps one do not want to be love so much as to be understand
O'Brien have torture him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it be certain he will sent him to his death
it make no difference
in some sense that go deep than friendship they be intimate somewhere or other although the actual word must never be speak there be a place where they can meet and talk
O'Brien be look down at him with a expression which suggest that the same thought must be in his own mind
when he speak it be in a easy conversational tone
do you know where you be Winston
he say
I do+not know
I can guess
in the ministry of love
do you know how long you have be here
I do+not know
day week month I think it be month
and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place
to make them confess
no that be not the reason
try again
to punish them
no exclaim O'Brien
his voice have change extraordinarily and his face have suddenly become both stern and animated
no
not merely to extract your confession not to punish you
shall I tell you why we have bring you here
to cure you
to make you sane
will you understand Winston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leave our hand uncure
we be not interested in those stupid crime that you have commit
the party be not interested in the overt act the thought be all we care about
we do not merely destroy our enemy we change them
do you understand what I mean by that
he be bend over Winston
his face look enormous because of its nearness and hideously ugly because it be see from below
moreover it be fill with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity
again Winston have heart shrink
if it have be possible he will have cower deep into the bed
he feel certain that O'Brien be about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness
at this moment however O'Brien turn away
he take a pace or two up and down
then he continue less vehemently
the first thing for you to understand be that in this place there be no martyrdom
you have read of the religious persecution of the past
in the middle age there be the Inquisition
it be a failure
it set out to eradicate heresy and end by perpetuate it
for every heretic it burn at the stake thousand of others rise up
why be that
because the inquisition kill its enemy in the open and kill them while they be still unrepentant in fact it kill them because they be unrepentant
man be die because they will not abandon their true belief
naturally all the glory belong to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burn him
later in the twentieth century there be the totalitarians as they be call
there be the German nazis and the Russian communist
the Russian persecute heresy more cruelly than the inquisition have do
and they imagine that they have learned from the mistake of the past they know at any rate that one must not make martyr
before they expose their victim to public trial they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity
they wear them down by torture and solitude until they be despicable cringe wretch confess whatever be put into their mouth cover themselves with abuse accuse and shelter behind one another whimper for mercy
and yet after only a few year the same thing have happen over again
the dead man have become martyr and their degradation be forget
once again why be it
in the first place because the confession that they have make be obviously extort and untrue
we do not make mistake of that kind
all the confession that be utter here be true
we make them true
and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us
you must stop imagine that posterity will vindicate you Winston
posterity will never hear of you
you will be lift clean out from the stream of history
we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere
nothing will remain of you not a name in a register not a memory in a living brain
you will be annihilate in the past as well as in the future
you will never have exist
then why bother to torture me
think Winston with a momentary bitterness
O'Brien check his step as though Winston have utter the thought aloud
his large ugly face come nearer with the eye a little narrow
you be think he say that since we intend to destroy you utterly so that nothing that you say or do can make the small difference in that case why do we go to the trouble of interrogate you first
that be what you be think be it not
yes say Winston
O'Brien smile slightly
you be a flaw in the pattern Winston
you be a stain that must be wipe out
do I not tell you just now that we be different from the persecutor of the past
we be not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission
when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will
we do not destroy the heretic because he resist us so long as he resist us we never destroy him
we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him
we burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul
we make him one of ourselves before we kill him
it be intolerable to us that a erroneous thought shall exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be
even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation
in the old day the heretic walk to the stake still a heretic proclaim his heresy exult in it
even the victim of the Russian purge can carry rebellion lock up in his skull as he walk down the passage wait for the bullet
but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
the command of the old despotism be thou shall not
the command of the totalitarians be thou shall
our command be thou art
no one whom we bring to this place ever stand out against us
everyone be wash clean
even those three miserable traitor in whose innocence you once believe jones aaronson and rutherford in the end we break them down
I take part in their interrogation myself
I see them gradually wear down whimper grovel weep and in the end it be not with pain or fear only with penitence
by the time we have finish with them they be only the shell of man
there be nothing leave in them except sorrow for what they have do and love of big brother
it be touching to see how they love him
they beg to be shoot quickly so that they can die while their mind be still clean
his voice have grow almost dreamy
the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasm be still in his face
he be not pretend think Winston he be not a hypocrite he believe every word he say
what most oppress him be the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority
he watch the heavy yet graceful form stroll to and fro in and out of the range of his vision
O'Brien be a being in all way large than himself
there be no idea that he have ever have or can have that O'Brien have not long ago know examine and reject
his mind contain Winston have mind
but in that case how can it be true that O'Brien be mad
it must be he Winston who be mad
O'Brien halt and look down at him
his voice have grow stern again
do not imagine that you will save yourself Winston however completely you surrender to us
no one who have once go astray be ever spare
and even if we choose to let you live out the natural term of your life still you will never escape from us
what happen to you here be for ever
understand that in advance
we shall crush you down to the point from which there be no come back
thing will happen to you from which you can not recover if you live a thousand year
never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling
everything will be dead inside you
never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity
you will be hollow
we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves
he pause and sign to the man in the white coat
Winston be aware of some heavy piece of apparatus be push into place behind his head
O'Brien have sit down beside the bed so that his face be almost on a level with Winston have
three thousand he say speak over Winston have head to the man in the white coat
two soft pad which feel slightly moist clamp themselves against Winston have temple
he quail
there be pain come a new kind of pain
O'Brien lay a hand reassuringly almost kindly on his
this time it will not hurt he say
keep your eye fix on mine
at this moment there be a devastating explosion or what seem like a explosion though it be not certain whether there be any noise
there be undoubtedly a blind flash of light
Winston be not hurt only prostrate
although he have already be lie on his back when the thing happen he have a curious feeling that he have be knock into that position
a terrific painless blow have flatten him out
also something have happen inside his head
as his eye regain their focus he remember who he be and where he be and recognize the face that be gaze into his own but somewhere or other there be a large patch of emptiness as though a piece have be take out of his brain
it will not last say O'Brien
look me in the eye
what country be Oceania at war with
Winston think
he know what be mean by Oceania and that he himself be a citizen of Oceania
he also remember Eurasia and Eastasia but who be at war with whom he do not know
in fact he have not be aware that there be any war
I do+not remember
Oceania be at war with Eastasia
do you remember that now
yes
Oceania have always be at war with Eastasia
since the beginning of your life since the beginning of the party since the beginning of history the war have continue without a break always the same war
do you remember that
yes
eleven year ago you create a legend about three man who have be condemn to death for treachery
you pretend that you have see a piece of paper which prove them innocent
no such piece of paper ever exist
you invent it and later you grow to believe in it
you remember now the very moment at which you first invent it
do you remember that
yes
just now I hold up the finger of my hand to you
you see five finger
do you remember that
yes
O'Brien hold up the finger of his left hand with the thumb conceal
there be five finger there
do you see five finger
yes
and he do see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of his mind change
he see five finger and there be no deformity
then everything be normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment come crowd back again
but there have be a moment he do not know how long thirty second perhaps of luminous certainty when each new suggestion of O'Brien have have fill up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and when two and two can have be three as easily as five if that be what be need
it have fade but before O'Brien have drop his hand but though he can not recapture it he can remember it as one remember a vivid experience at some period of one have life when one be in effect a different person
you see now say O'Brien that it be at any rate possible
yes say Winston
O'Brien stand up with a satisfied air
over to his left Winston see the man in the white coat break a ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe
O'Brien turn to Winston with a smile
in almost the old manner he resettle his spectacle on his nose
do you remember write in your diary he say that it do not matter whether I be a friend or a enemy since I be at least a person who understand you and can be talk to
you be right
I enjoy talk to you
your mind appeal to me
it resemble my own mind except that you happen to be insane
before we bring the session to a end you can ask me a few question if you choose
any question I like
anything
he see that Winston have eye be upon the dial
it be switch off
what be your first question
what have you do with julia
say Winston
O'Brien smile again
she betray you Winston
immediately unreserved
I have seldom see anyone come over to us so promptly
you will hardly recognize her if you see her
all her rebelliousness her deceit her folly her dirty-mindedness everything have be burn out of her
it be a perfect conversion a textbook case
you torture her
O'Brien leave this unanswered
next question he say
do big brother exist
of course he exist
the party exist
big brother be the embodiment of the party
do he exist in the same way as I exist
you do not exist say O'Brien
once again the sense of helplessness assail him
he know or he can imagine the argument which prove his own nonexistence but they be nonsense they be only a play on word
do not the statement you do not exist contain a logical absurdity
but what use be it to say so
his mind shrivel as he think of the unanswerable mad argument with which O'Brien will demolish him
I think I exist he say wearily
I be conscious of my own identity
I be born and I shall die
I have arm and leg
I occupy a particular point in space
no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously
in that sense do big brother exist
it be of no importance
he exist
will big brother ever die
of course not
how can he die
next question
do the brotherhood exist
that Winston you will never know
if we choose to set you free when we have finish with you and if you live to be ninety year old still you will never learn whether the answer to that question be yes or no
as long as you live it will be a unsolved riddle in your mind
Winston lie silent
his breast rise and fall a little fast
he still have not ask the question that have come into his mind the first
he have get to ask it and yet it be as though his tongue will not utter it
there be a trace of amusement in O'Brien have face
even his spectacle seem to wear a ironical gleam
he know think Winston suddenly he know what I be go to ask
at the thought the word burst out of him
what be in room 101
the expression on O'Brien have face do not change
he answer drily
you know what be in room 101 Winston
everyone know what be in room 101
he raise a finger to the man in the white coat
evidently the session be at a end
a needle jerk into Winston have arm
he sink almost instantly into deep sleep
there be three stage in your reintegration say O'Brien
there be learning there be understanding and there be acceptance
it be time for you to enter upon the second stage
as always Winston be lie flat on his back
but of late his bond be loose
they still hold him to the bed but he can move his knee a little and can turn his head from side to side and raise his arm from the elbow
the dial also have grow to be less of a terror
he can evade its pang if he be quick-witted enough it be chiefly when he show stupidity that O'Brien pull the lever
sometimes they get through a whole session without use of the dial
he can not remember how many session there have be
the whole process seem to stretch out over a long indefinite time week possibly and the interval between the session must sometimes have be day sometimes only a hour or two
as you lie there say O'Brien you have often wonder you have even ask me why the ministry of love shall expend so much time and trouble on you
and when you be free you be puzzle by what be essentially the same question
you can grasp the mechanics of the society you live in but not its underlying motive
do you remember write in your diary I understand how I do not understand why
it be when you think about why that you doubt your own sanity
you have read the book Goldstein have book or part of it at least
do it tell you anything that you do not know already
you have read it
say Winston
I write it
that be to say I collaborate in write it
no book be produce individually as you know
be it true what it say
a description yes
the programme it set forth be nonsense
the secret accumulation of knowledge a gradual spread of enlightenment ultimately a proletarian rebellion the overthrow of the party
you foresee yourself that that be what it will say
it be all nonsense
the proletarian will never revolt not in a thousand year or a million
they cannot
I do not have to tell you the reason you know it already
if you have ever cherish any dream of violent insurrection you must abandon them
there be no way in which the party can be overthrow
the rule of the party be for ever
make that the starting-point of your thought
he come close to the bed
for ever he repeat
and now let us get back to the question of how and why
you understand well enough how the party maintain itself in power
now tell me why we cling to power
what be our motive
why shall we want power
go on speak he add as Winston remain silent
nevertheless Winston do not speak for another moment or two
a feeling of weariness have overwhelm him
the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm have come back into O'Brien have face
he know in advance what O'Brien will say
that the party do not seek power for its own end but only for the good of the majority
that it sought power because man in the mass be frail cowardly creature who can not endure liberty or face the truth and must be rule over and systematically deceive by others who be strong than themselves
that the choice for mankind lie between freedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness be good
that the party be the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect do evil that good must come sacrifice its own happiness to that of others
the terrible thing think Winston the terrible thing be that when O'Brien say this he will believe it
you can see it in his face
O'Brien know everything
a thousand time better than Winston he know what the world be really like in what degradation the mass of human being live and by what lie and barbarity the party keep them there
he have understand it all weigh it all and it make no difference all be justify by the ultimate purpose
what can you do think Winston against the lunatic who be more intelligent than yourself who give your argument a fair hearing and then simply persist in his lunacy
you be rule over us for our own good he say feebly
you believe that human being be not fit to govern themselves and therefore
he start and almost cry out
a pang of pain have shoot through his body
O'Brien have push the lever of the dial up to thirty-five
that be stupid Winston stupid he say
you shall know better than to say a thing like that
he pull the lever back and continue
now I will tell you the answer to my question
it be this
the party seek power entirely for its own sake
we be not interested in the good of others we be interested solely in power
not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power
what pure power mean you will understand presently
we be different from all the oligarchy of the past in that we know what we be do
all the others even those who resemble ourselves be coward and hypocrite
the German nazis and the Russian communist come very close to us in their method but they never have the courage to recognize their own motive
they pretend perhaps they even believe that they have seize power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lie a paradise where human being will be free and equal
we be not like that
we know that no one ever seize power with the intention of relinquish it
power be not a means it be a end
one do not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one make the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship
the object of persecution be persecution
the object of torture be torture
the object of power be power
now do you begin to understand me
Winston be strike as he have be strike before by the tiredness of O'Brien have face
it be strong and fleshy and brutal it be full of intelligence and a sort of control passion before which he feel himself helpless but it be tired
there be pouch under the eye the skin sag from the cheekbone
O'Brien lean over him deliberately bring the wear face nearer
you be think he say that my face be old and tired
you be think that I talk of power and yet I be not even able to prevent the decay of my own body
can you not understand Winston that the individual be only a cell
the weariness of the cell be the vigour of the organism
do you die when you cut your fingernail
he turn away from the bed and begin stroll up and down again one hand in his pocket
we be the priest of power he say
god be power
but at present power be only a word so far as you be concern
it be time for you to gather some idea of what power mean
the first thing you must realize be that power be collective
the individual only have power in so far as he cease to be a individual
you know the party slogan freedom be slavery
have it ever occur to you that it be reversible
slavery be freedom
alone free the human being be always defeat
it must be so because every human being be doom to die which be the great of all failure
but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from his identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he be the party then he be all-powerful and immortal
the second thing for you to realize be that power be power over human being
over the body but above all over the mind
power over matter external reality as you will call it be not important
already our control over matter be absolute
for a moment Winston ignore the dial
he make a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merely succeed in wrench his body painfully
but how can you control matter
he burst out
you do+not even control the climate or the law of gravity
and there be disease pain death
O'Brien silence him by a movement of his hand
we control mat because we control the mind
reality be inside the skull
you will learn by degree Winston
there be nothing that we can not do
invisibility levitation anything
I can float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to
I do not wish to because the party do not wish it
you must get rid of those nineteenth-century idea about the law of nature
we make the law of nature
but you do not
you be not even master of this planet
what about Eurasia and Eastasia
you have not conquer them yet
unimportant
we shall conquer them when it suit us
and if we do not what difference will it make
we can shut them out of existence
Oceania be the world
but the world itself be only a speck of dust
and man be tiny helpless
how long have he be in existence
for million of year the earth be uninhabited
nonsense
the earth be as old as we be no old
how can it be old
nothing exist except through human consciousness
but the rock be full of the bone of extinct animal mammoth and mastodon and enormous reptile which live here long before man be ever hear of
have you ever see those bone Winston
of course not
nineteenth-century biologist invent them
before man there be nothing
after man if he can come to a end there will be nothing
outside man there be nothing
but the whole universe be outside us
look at the star
some of them be a million light-year away
they be out of our reach for ever
what be the star
say O'Brien indifferently
they be bit of fire a few kilometre away
we can reach them if we want to
or we can blot them out
the earth be the centre of the universe
the sun and the star go round it
Winston make another convulsive movement
this time he do not say anything
O'Brien continue as though answer a speak objection
for certain purpose of course that be not true
when we navigate the ocean or when we predict a eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth go round the sun and that the star be million upon million of kilometre away
but what of it
do you suppose it be beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy
the star can be near or distant accord as we need them
do you suppose our mathematician be unequal to that
have you forget doublethink
Winston shrink back upon the bed
whatever he say the swift answer crush him like a bludgeon
and yet he know he know that he be in the right
the belief that nothing exist outside your own mind surely there must be some way of demonstrate that it be false
have it not be expose long ago as a fallacy
there be even a name for it which he have forget
a faint smile twitch the corner of O'Brien have mouth as he look down at him
I tell you Winston he say that metaphysics be not your strong point
the word you be try to think of be solipsism
but you be mistaken
this be not solipsism
collective solipsism if you like
but that be a different thing in fact the opposite thing
all this be a digression he add in a different tone
the real power the power we have to fight for night and day be not power over thing but over man
he pause and for a moment assume again his air of a schoolmaster question a promising pupil how do one man assert his power over another Winston
Winston think
by make him suffer he say
exactly
by make him suffer
obedience be not enough
unless he be suffer how can you be sure that he be obey your will and not his own
power be in inflict pain and humiliation
power be in tear human mind to piece and put them together again in new shape of your own choose
do you begin to see then what kind of world we be create
it be the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopia that the old reformer imagine
a world of fear and treachery be torment a world of trample and be trample upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refine itself
progress in our world will be progress towards more pain
the old civilization claim that they be found on love or justice
ours be found upon hatred
in our world there will be no emotion except fear rage triumph and self-abasement
everything else we shall destroy everything
already we be break down the habit of thought which have survive from before the revolution
we have cut the link between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
no one dare trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer
but in the future there will be no wife and no friend
child will be take from their mother at birth as one take egg from a hen
the sex instinct will be eradicate
procreation will be a annual formality like the renewal of a ration card
we shall abolish the orgasm
our neurologist be at work upon it now
there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party
there will be no love except the love of big brother
there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeat enemy
there will be no art no literature no science
when we be omnipotent we shall have no more need of science
there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness
there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life
all compete pleasure will be destroy
but always do not forget this Winston always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increase and constantly grow subtle
always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trample on a enemy who be helpless
if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamp on a human face for ever
he pause as though he expect Winston to speak
Winston have try to shrink back into the surface of the bed again
he can not say anything
his heart seem to be frozen
O'Brien go on
and remember that it be for ever
the face will always be there to be stamp upon
the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeat and humiliate over again
everything that you have undergo since you have be in our hand all that will continue and worse
the espionage the betrayal the arrest the torture the execution the disappearance will never cease
it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph
the more the party be powerful the less it will be tolerant the weak the opposition the tight the despotism
Goldstein and his heresy will live for ever
every day at every moment they will be defeat discredit ridicule spat upon and yet they will always survive
this drama that I have play out with you during seven year will be play out over and over again generation after generation always in subtle form
always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy scream with pain break up contemptible and in the end utterly penitent save from himself crawl to our foot of his own accord
that be the world that we be prepare Winston
a world of victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph a endless press press press upon the nerve of power
you be begin I can see to realize what that world will be like
but in the end you will do more than understand it
you will accept it welcome it become part of it
Winston have recover himself sufficiently to speak
you can+not he say weakly
what do you mean by that remark Winston
you can not create such a world as you have just describe
it be a dream
it be impossible
why
it be impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty
it will never endure
why not
it will have no vitality
it will disintegrate
it will commit suicide
nonsense
you be under the impression that hatred be more exhaust than love
why shall it be
and if it be what difference will that make
suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out fast
suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till man be senile at thirty
still what difference will it make
can you not understand that the death of the individual be not death
the party be immortal
as usual the voice have batter Winston into helplessness
moreover he be in dread that if he persist in his disagreement O'Brien will twist the dial again
and yet he can not keep silent
feebly without argument with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what O'Brien have say he return to the attack
I do+not know I do+not care
somehow you will fail
something will defeat you
life will defeat you
we control life Winston at all its level
you be imagine that there be something call human nature which will be outrage by what we do and will turn against us
but we create human nature
man be infinitely malleable
or perhaps you have return to your old idea that the proletarian or the slave will arise and overthrow us
put it out of your mind
they be helpless like the animal
humanity be the party
the others be outside irrelevant
I do+not care
in the end they will beat you
sooner or later they will see you for what you be and then they will tear you to piece
do you see any evidence that that be happen
or any reason why it shall
no
I believe it
I know that you will fail
there be something in the universe I do+not know some spirit some principle that you will never overcome
do you believe in god Winston
no
then what be it this principle that will defeat us
I do+not know
the spirit of man
and do you consider yourself a man
yes
if you be a man Winston you be the last man
your kind be extinct we be the inheritor
do you understand that you be alone
you be outside history you be non-existent
his manner change and he say more harshly and you consider yourself morally superior to us with our lie and our cruelty
yes I consider myself superior
O'Brien do not speak
two other voice be speak
after a moment Winston recognize one of them as his own
it be a sound-track of the conversation he have have with O'Brien on the night when he have enroll himself in the brotherhood
he hear himself promise to lie to steal to forge to murder to encourage drug-taking and prostitution to disseminate venereal disease to throw vitriol in a child have face
O'Brien make a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstration be hardly worth make
then he turn a switch and the voice stop
get up from that bed he say
the bond have loosen themselves
Winston lower himself to the floor and stand up unsteadily
you be the last man say O'Brien
you be the guardian of the human spirit
you shall see yourself as you be
take off your clothes
Winston undo the bit of string that hold his overall together
the zip fastener have long since be wrench out of them
he can not remember whether at any time since his arrest he have take off all his clothes at one time
beneath the overall his body be loop with filthy yellowish rag just recognizable as the remnant of underclothes
as he slide them to the ground he see that there be a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room
he approach it then stop short
a involuntary cry have break out of him
go on say O'Brien
stand between the wing of the mirror
you shall see the side view as well
he have stop because he be frightened
a bowed greycoloured skeleton-like thing be come towards him
its actual appearance be frightening and not merely the fact that he know it to be himself
he move close to the glass
the creature have face seem to be protrude because of its bent carriage
a forlorn jailbird have face with a nobby forehead run back into a bald scalp a crooked nose and battered-looking cheekbone above which his eye be fierce and watchful
the cheek be seamed the mouth have a draw-in look
certainly it be his own face but it seem to him that it have change more than he have change inside
the emotion it register will be different from the one he feel
he have go partially bald
for the first moment he have think that he have go grey as well but it be only the scalp that be grey
except for his hand and a circle of his face his body be grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt
here and there under the dirt there be the red scar of wound and near the ankle the varicose ulcer be a inflamed mass with flake of skin peel off it
but the truly frightening thing be the emaciation of his body
the barrel of the rib be as narrow as that of a skeleton the leg have shrink so that the knee be thick than the thigh
he see now what O'Brien have mean about see the side view
the curvature of the spine be astonishing
the thin shoulder be hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seem to be bend double under the weight of the skull
at a guess he will have say that it be the body of a man of sixty suffer from some malignant disease
you have think sometimes say O'Brien that my face the face of a member of the inner party look old and wear
what do you think of your own face
he seize Winston have shoulder and spin him round so that he be face him
look at the condition you be in he say
look at this filthy grime all over your body
look at the dirt between your toe
look at that disgusting running sore on your leg
do you know that you stink like a goat
probably you have cease to notice it
look at your emaciation
do you see
I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep
I can snap your neck like a carrot
do you know that you have lose twenty-five kilogram since you have be in our hand
even your hair be come out in handful
look
he pluck at Winston have head and bring away a tuft of hair
open your mouth
nine ten eleven tooth leave
how many have you when you come to us
and the few you have leave be drop out of your head
look here
he seize one of Winston have remaining front tooth between his powerful thumb and forefinger
a twinge of pain shoot through Winston have jaw
O'Brien have wrench the loose tooth out by the root
he toss it across the cell
you be rot away he say you be fall to piece
what be you
a bag of filth
now turn around and look into that mirror again
do you see that thing face you
that be the last man
if you be human that be humanity
now put your clothes on again
Winston begin to dress himself with slow stiff movement
until now he have not seem to notice how thin and weak he be
only one thought stir in his mind that he must have be in this place longer than he have imagine
then suddenly as he fix the miserable rag round himself a feeling of pity for his ruin body overcome him
before he know what he be do he have collapse on to a small stool that stand beside the bed and burst into tear
he be aware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bone in filthy underclothes sit weep in the harsh white light but he can not stop himself
O'Brien lay a hand on his shoulder almost kindly
it will not last for ever he say
you can escape from it whenever you choose
everything depend on yourself
you do it sob Winston
you reduce me to this state
no Winston you reduce yourself to it
this be what you accept when you set yourself up against the party
it be all contain in that first act
nothing have happen that you do not foresee
he pause and then go on
we have beaten you Winston
we have broken you up
you have see what your body be like
your mind be in the same state
I do not think there can be much pride leave in you
you have be kick and flog and insult you have scream with pain you have roll on the floor in your own blood and vomit
you have whimper for mercy you have betray everybody and everything
can you think of a single degradation that have not happen to you
Winston have stop weep though the tear be still ooze out of his eye
he look up at O'Brien
I have not betray julia he say
O'Brien look down at him thoughtfully
no he say no that be perfectly true
you have not betray julia
the peculiar reverence for O'Brien which nothing seem able to destroy flood Winston have heart again
how intelligent he think how intelligent
never do O'Brien fail to understand what be say to him
anyone else on earth will have answer promptly that he have betray julia
for what be there that they have not screw out of him under the torture
he have tell them everything he know about her her habit her character her past life he have confess in the most trivial detail everything that have happen at their meeting all that he have say to her and she to him their black-market meal their adultery their vague plotting against the party everything
and yet in the sense in which he intend the word he have not betray her
he have not stop love her his feeling towards her have remain the same
O'Brien have see what he mean without the need for explanation
tell me he say how soon will they shoot me
it must be a long time say O'Brien
you be a difficult case
but do+not give up hope
everyone be cure sooner or later
in the end we shall shoot you
he be much better
he be grow fat and strong every day if it be proper to speak of day
the white light and the hum sound be the same as ever but the cell be a little more comfortable than the others he have be in
there be a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on
they have give him a bath and they allow him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin
they even give him warm water to wash with
they have give him new underclothes and a clean suit of overall
they have dress his varicose ulcer with soothe ointment
they have pull out the remnant of his tooth and give him a new set of denture
week or month must have pass
it will have be possible now to keep count of the passage of time if he have feel any interest in do so since he be be feed at what appear to be regular interval
he be get he judge three meal in the twenty-four hour sometimes he wonder dimly whether he be get them by night or by day
the food be surprisingly good with meat at every third meal
once there be even a packet of cigarette
he have no match but the never-speaking guard who bring his food will give him a light
the first time he try to smoke it make him sick but he persevere and spin the packet out for a long time smoke half a cigarette after each meal
they have give him a white slate with a stump of pencil tie to the corner
at first he make no use of it
even when he be awake he be completely torpid
often he will lie from one meal to the next almost without stir sometimes asleep sometimes wake into vague reverie in which it be too much trouble to open his eye
he have long grown used to sleep with a strong light on his face
it seem to make no difference except that one have dream be more coherent
he dream a great deal all through this time and they be always happy dream
he be in the golden country or he be sit among enormous glorious sunlit ruin with his mother with julia with O'Brien not do anything merely sit in the sun talk of peaceful thing
such thought as he have when he be awake be mostly about his dream
he seem to have lose the power of intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain have be remove
he be not bored he have no desire for conversation or distraction
merely to be alone not to be beaten or question to have enough to eat and to be clean all over be completely satisfying
by degree he come to spend less time in sleep but he still feel no impulse to get off the bed
all he care for be to lie quiet and feel the strength gather in his body
he will finger himself here and there try to make sure that it be not a illusion that his muscle be grow round and his skin taut
finally it be establish beyond a doubt that he be grow fat his thigh be now definitely thick than his knee
after that reluctantly at first he begin exercise himself regularly
in a little while he can walk three kilometre measure by pace the cell and his bowed shoulder be grow straight
he attempt more elaborate exercise and be astonish and humiliate to find what thing he can not do
he can not move out of a walk he can not hold his stool out at arm have length he can not stand on one leg without fall over
he squat down on his heel and found that with agonizing pain in thigh and calf he can just lift himself to a standing position
he lie flat on his belly and try to lift his weight by his hand
it be hopeless he can not raise himself a centimetre
but after a few more day a few more mealtime even that feat be accomplish
a time come when he can do it six time running
he begin to grow actually proud of his body and to cherish a intermittent belief that his face also be grow back to normal
only when he chance to put his hand on his bald scalp do he remember the seamed ruin face that have look back at him out of the mirror
his mind grow more active
he sit down on the plank bed his back against the wall and the slate on his knee and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educate himself
he have capitulate that be agree
in reality as he see now he have be ready to capitulate long before he have take the decision
from the moment when he be inside the ministry of love and yes even during those minute when he and julia have stand helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen tell them what to do he have grasp the frivolity the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party
he know now that for seven year the thought police have watch him like a beetle under a magnify glass
there be no physical act no word speak aloud that they have not notice no train of thought that they have not be able to infer
even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they have carefully replace
they have play sound-track to him show him photograph
some of them be photograph of julia and himself
yes even he can not fight against the party any longer
besides the party be in the right
it must be so how can the immortal collective brain be mistaken
by what external standard can you check its judgement
sanity be statistical
it be merely a question of learn to think as they think
only
the pencil feel thick and awkward in his finger
he begin to write down the thought that come into his head
he write first in large clumsy capital freedom be slavery
then almost without a pause he write beneath it two and two make five
but then there come a sort of check
his mind as though shy away from something seem unable to concentrate
he know that he know what come next but for the moment he can not recall it
when he do recall it it be only by consciously reason out what it must be it do not come of its own accord
he write god be power
he accept everything
the past be alterable
the past never have be alter
Oceania be at war with Eastasia
Oceania have always be at war with Eastasia
jones aaronson and rutherford be guilty of the crime they be charge with
he have never see the photograph that disprove their guilt
it have never exist he have invent it
he remember remember contrary thing but those be false memory product of selfdeception
how easy it all be
only surrender and everything else follow
it be like swim against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggle and then suddenly decide to turn round and go with the current instead of oppose it
nothing have change except your own attitude the predestined thing happen in any case
he hardly know why he have ever rebel
everything be easy except
anything can be true
the so-called law of nature be nonsense
the law of gravity be nonsense
if I wish O'Brien have say I can float off this floor like a soap bubble
Winston work it out
if he think he float off the floor and if I simultaneously think I see him do it then the thing happen
suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage break the surface of water the thought burst into his mind it do+not really happen
we imagine it
it be hallucination
he push the thought under instantly
the fallacy be obvious
it presuppose that somewhere or other outside oneself there be a real world where real thing happen
but how can there be such a world
what knowledge have we of anything save through our own mind
all happening be in the mind
whatever happen in all mind truly happen
he have no difficulty in dispose of the fallacy and he be in no danger of succumb to it
he realize nevertheless that it ought never to have occur to him
the mind shall develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought present itself
the process shall be automatic instinctive
crimestop they call it in Newspeak
he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop
he present himself with proposition the party say the earth be flat the party say that ice be heavy than water and train himself in not see or not understand the argument that contradict them
it be not easy
it need great power of reason and improvisation
the arithmetical problem raise for instance by such a statement as two and two make five be beyond his intellectual grasp
it need also a sort of athleticism of mind a ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crude logical error
stupidity be as necessary as intelligence and as difficult to attain
all the while with one part of his mind he wonder how soon they will shoot him
everything depend on yourself O'Brien have say but he know that there be no conscious act by which he can bring it nearer
it must be ten minute hence or ten year
they must keep him for year in solitary confinement they must sent him to a labour-camp they must release him for a while as they sometimes do
it be perfectly possible that before he be shoot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation will be enact all over again
the one certain thing be that death never come at a expected moment
the tradition the unspoken tradition somehow you know it though you never hear it say be that they shoot you from behind always in the back of the head without warning as you walk down a corridor from cell to cell
one day but one day be not the right expression just as probably it be in the middle of the night once he fall into a strange blissful reverie
he be walk down the corridor wait for the bullet
he know that it be come in another moment
everything be settle smooth out reconcile
there be no more doubt no more argument no more pain no more fear
his body be healthy and strong
he walk easily with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walk in sunlight
he be not any longer in the narrow white corridor in the ministry of love he be in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he have seem to walk in the delirium induce by drug
he be in the golden country follow the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture
he can feel the short springy turf under his foot and the gentle sunshine on his face
at the edge of the field be the elm tree faintly stir and somewhere beyond that be the stream where the dace lie in the green pool under the willow
suddenly he start up with a shock of horror
the sweat break out on his backbone
he have hear himself cry aloud
julia
julia
julia my love
julia
for a moment he have have a overwhelming hallucination of her presence
she have seem to be not merely with him but inside him
it be as though she have get into the texture of his skin
in that moment he have love her far more than he have ever do when they be together and free
also he know that somewhere or other she be still alive and need his help
he lie back on the bed and try to compose himself
what have he do
how many year have he add to his servitude by that moment of weakness
in another moment he will hear the tramp of boot outside
they can not let such a outburst go unpunished
they will know now if they have not know before that he be break the agreement he have make with them
he obey the party but he still hate the party
in the old day he have hide a heretical mind beneath a appearance of conformity
now he have retreat a step further in the mind he have surrender but he have hope to keep the inner heart inviolate
he know that he be in the wrong but he prefer to be in the wrong
they will understand that O'Brien will understand it
it be all confess in that single foolish cry
he will have to start all over again
it must take year
he run a hand over his face try to familiarize himself with the new shape
there be deep furrow in the cheek the cheekbone feel sharp the nose flatten
besides since last see himself in the glass he have be give a complete new set of tooth
it be not easy to preserve inscrutability when you do not know what your face look like
in any case mere control of the feature be not enough
for the first time he perceive that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself
you must know all the while that it be there but until it be need you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that can be give a name
from now onwards he must not only think right he must feel right dream right
and all the while he must keep his hatred lock up inside him like a ball of matter which be part of himself and yet unconnect with the rest of him a kind of cyst
one day they will decide to shoot him
you can not tell when it will happen but a few second beforehand it shall be possible to guess
it be always from behind walk down a corridor
ten second will be enough
in that time the world inside him can turn over
and then suddenly without a word utter without a check in his step without the changing of a line in his face suddenly the camouflage will be down and bang will go the battery of his hatred
hatred will fill him like a enormous roaring flame
and almost in the same instant bang will go the bullet too late or too early
they will have blow his brain to piece before they can reclaim it
the heretical thought will be unpunished unrepented out of their reach for ever
they will have blow a hole in their own perfection
to die hate them that be freedom
he shut his eye
it be more difficult than accept a intellectual discipline
it be a question of degrade himself mutilate himself
he have get to plunge into the filthy of filth
what be the most horrible sickening thing of all
he think of big brother
the enormous face because of constantly see it on poster he always think of it as be a metre wide with its heavy black moustache and the eye that follow you to and fro seem to float into his mind of its own accord
what be his true feeling towards big brother
there be a heavy tramp of boot in the passage
the steel door swing open with a clang
O'Brien walk into the cell
behind him be the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed guard
get up say O'Brien
come here
Winston stand opposite him
O'Brien take Winston have shoulder between his strong hand and look at him closely
you have have thought of deceive me he say
that be stupid
stand up straight
look me in the face
he pause and go on in a gentle tone
you be improve
intellectually there be very little wrong with you
it be only emotionally that you have fail to make progress
tell me Winston and remember no lie you know that I be always able to detect a lie tell me what be your true feeling towards big brother
I hate him
you hate him
good
then the time have come for you to take the last step
you must love big brother
it be not enough to obey him you must love him
he release Winston with a little push towards the guard
room 101 he say
at each stage of his imprisonment he have know or seem to know whereabouts he be in the windowless building
possibly there be slight difference in the air pressure
the cell where the guard have beat him be below ground level
the room where he have be interrogate by O'Brien be high up near the roof
this place be many metre underground as deep down as it be possible to go
it be big than most of the cell he have be in
but he hardly notice his surroundings
all he notice be that there be two small table straight in front of him each cover with green baize
one be only a metre or two from him the other be further away near the door
he be strap upright in a chair so tightly that he can move nothing not even his head
a sort of pad grip his head from behind force him to look straight in front of him
for a moment he be alone then the door open and O'Brien come in
you ask me once say O'Brien what be in room 101
I tell you that you know the answer already
everyone know it
the thing that be in room 101 be the bad thing in the world
the door open again
a guard come in carry something make of wire a box or basket of some kind
he set it down on the further table
because of the position in which O'Brien be stand Winston can not see what the thing be
the bad thing in the world say O'Brien vary from individual to individual
it may be burial alive or death by fire or by drowning or by impalement or fifty other death
there be case where it be some quite trivial thing not even fatal
he have move a little to one side so that Winston have a good view of the thing on the table
it be a oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carry it by
fix to the front of it be something that look like a fencing mask with the concave side outwards
although it be three or four metre away from him he can see that the cage be divide lengthways into two compartment and that there be some kind of creature in each
they be rat
in your case say O'Brien the bad thing in the world happen to be rat
a sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he be not certain what have pass through Winston as soon as he catch his first glimpse of the cage
but at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sink into him
his bowel seem to turn to water
you can+not do that he cry out in a high cracked voice
you could+not you could+not
it be impossible
do you remember say O'Brien the moment of panic that use to occur in your dream
there be a wall of blackness in front of you and a roaring sound in your ear
there be something terrible on the other side of the wall
you know that you know what it be but you dare not drag it into the open
it be the rat that be on the other side of the wall
O'Brien say Winston make a effort to control his voice
you know this be not necessary
what be it that you want me to do
O'Brien make no direct answer
when he speak it be in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affect
he look thoughtfully into the distance as though he be address a audience somewhere behind Winston have back
by itself he say pain be not always enough
there be occasion when a human being will stand out against pain even to the point of death
but for everyone there be something unendurable something that cannot be contemplate
courage and cowardice be not involved
if you be fall from a height it be not cowardly to clutch at a rope
if you have come up from deep water it be not cowardly to fill your lung with air
it be merely a instinct which cannot be destroy
it be the same with the rat
for you they be unendurable
they be a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wish to
you will do what be require of you
but what be it what be it
how can I do it if I do+not know what it be
O'Brien pick up the cage and bring it across to the near table
he set it down carefully on the baize cloth
Winston can hear the blood sing in his ear
he have the feeling of sit in utter loneliness
he be in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drench with sunlight across which all sound come to him out of immense distance
yet the cage with the rat be not two metre away from him
they be enormous rat
they be at the age when a rat have muzzle grow blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey
the rat say O'Brien still address his invisible audience although a rodent be carnivorous
you be aware of that
you will have hear of the thing that happen in the poor quarter of this town
in some street a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house even for five minute
the rat be certain to attack it
within quite a small time they will strip it to the bone
they also attack sick or dying people
they show astonishing intelligence in know when a human being be helpless
there be a outburst of squeal from the cage
it seem to reach Winston from far away
the rat be fight they be try to get at each other through the partition
he hear also a deep groan of despair
that too seem to come from outside himself
O'Brien pick up the cage and as he do so press something in it
there be a sharp click
Winston make a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair
it be hopeless every part of him even his head be hold immovably
O'Brien move the cage nearer
it be less than a metre from Winston have face
I have press the first lever say O'Brien
you understand the construction of this cage
the mask will fit over your head leave no exit
when I press this other lever the door of the cage will slide up
these starve brute will shoot out of it like bullet
have you ever see a rat leap through the air
they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it
sometimes they attack the eye first
sometimes they burrow through the cheek and devour the tongue
the cage be nearer it be close in
Winston hear a succession of shrill cry which appear to be occur in the air above his head
but he fight furiously against his panic
to think to think even with a split second leave to think be the only hope
suddenly the foul musty odour of the brute strike his nostril
there be a violent convulsion of nausea inside him and he almost lose consciousness
everything have go black
for a instant he be insane a screaming animal
yet he come out of the blackness clutch a idea
there be one and only one way to save himself
he must interpose another human being the body of another human being between himself and the rat
the circle of the mask be large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else
the wire door be a couple of hand-spans from his face
the rat know what be come now
one of them be leap up and down the other a old scaly grandfather of the sewer stand up with his pink hand against the bar and fiercely sniff the air
Winston can see the whisker and the yellow tooth
again the black panic take hold of him
he be blind helpless mindless
it be a common punishment in imperial China say O'Brien as didactic as ever
the mask be close on his face
the wire brush his cheek
and then no it be not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope
too late perhaps too late
but he have suddenly understand that in the whole world there be just one person to whom he can transfer his punishment one body that he can thrust between himself and the rat
and he be shout frantically over and over
do it to julia
do it to julia
not me
julia
I do+not care what you do to her
tear her face off strip her to the bone
not me
julia
not me
he be fall backwards into enormous depth away from the rat
he be still strap in the chair but he have fall through the floor through the wall of the building through the earth through the ocean through the atmosphere into outer space into the gulf between the star always away away away from the rat
he be light year distant but O'Brien be still stand at his side
there be still the cold touch of wire against his cheek
but through the darkness that envelop him he hear another metallic click and know that the cage door have click shut and not open
the chestnut tree be almost empty
a ray of sunlight slant through a window fall on dusty table-tops
it be the lonely hour of fifteen
a tinny music trickle from the telescreen
Winston sit in his usual corner gaze into a empty glass
now and again he glance up at a vast face which eye him from the opposite wall
big brother be watch you the caption say
unbidden a waiter come and fill his glass up with victory gin shake into it a few drop from another bottle with a quill through the cork
it be saccharine flavour with clove the speciality of the cafe
Winston be listen to the telescreen
at present only music be come out of it but there be a possibility that at any moment there must be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace
the news from the African front be disquieting in the extreme
on and off he have be worry about it all day
a Eurasian army Oceania be at war with Eurasia Oceania have always be at war with Eurasia be move southward at terrifying speed
the mid-day bulletin have not mention any definite area but it be probable that already the mouth of the Congo be a battlefield
Brazzaville and leopoldville be in danger
one do not have to look at the map to see what it mean
it be not merely a question of lose central Africa for the first time in the whole war the territory of Oceania itself be menace
a violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flare up in him then fade again
he stop think about the war
in these day he can never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moment at a time
he pick up his glass and drain it at a gulp
as always the gin make him shudder and even retch slightly
the stuff be horrible
the clove and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way can not disguise the flat oily smell and what be bad of all be that the smell of gin which dwelt with him night and day be inextricably mix up in his mind with the smell of those
he never name them even in his thought and so far as it be possible he never visualize them
they be something that he be half-aware of hover close to his face a smell that cling to his nostril
as the gin rise in him he belch through purple lip
he have grown fat since they release him and have regain his old colour indeed more than regain it
his feature have thicken the skin on nose and cheekbone be coarsely red even the bald scalp be too deep a pink
a waiter again unbidden bring the chessboard and the current issue of the Times with the page turn down at the chess problem
then see that Winston have glass be empty he bring the gin bottle and fill it
there be no need to give order
they know his habit
the chessboard be always wait for him his corner table be always reserve even when the place be full he have it to himself since nobody care to be see sit too close to him
he never even bother to count his drink
at irregular interval they present him with a dirty slip of paper which they say be the bill but he have the impression that they always undercharged him
it will have make no difference if it have be the other way about
he have always plenty of money nowadays
he even have a job a sinecure more highly-paid than his old job have be
the music from the telescreen stop and a voice take over
Winston raise his head to listen
no bulletin from the front however
it be merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty
in the preceding quarter it appear the tenth three year plan have quota for bootlace have be overfulfilled by 98 per cent
he examine the chess problem and set out the piece
it be a tricky ending involve a couple of knight
white to play and mate in two move
Winston look up at the portrait of big brother
white always mate he think with a sort of cloudy mysticism
always without exception it be so arrange
in no chess problem since the beginning of the world have black ever win
do it not symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of good over evil
the huge face gaze back at him full of calm power
white always mate
the voice from the telescreen pause and add in a different and much grave tone you be warn to stand by for a important announcement at fifteen-thirty
fifteen-thirty
this be news of the high importance
take care not to miss it
fifteen-thirty
the tinking music strike up again
Winston have heart stir
that be the bulletin from the front instinct tell him that it be bad news that be come
all day with little spurt of excitement the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa have be in and out of his mind
he seem actually to see the Eurasian army swarm across the never-broken frontier and pour down into the tip of Africa like a column of ant
why have it not be possible to outflank them in some way
the outline of the west African coast stand out vividly in his mind
he pick up the white knight and move it across the board
there be the proper spot
even while he see the black horde race southward he see another force mysteriously assemble suddenly plant in their rear cut their communications by land and sea
he feel that by will it he be bring that other force into existence
but it be necessary to act quickly
if they can get control of the whole of Africa if they have airfield and submarine base at the cape it will cut Oceania in two
it must mean anything defeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party
he draw a deep breath
a extraordinary medley of feeling but it be not a medley exactly rather it be successive layer of feeling in which one can not say which layer be undermost struggle inside him
the spasm pass
he put the white knight back in its place but for the moment he can not settle down to serious study of the chess problem
his thought wander again
almost unconsciously he trace with his finger in the dust on the table 2+2=5
they can+not get inside you she have say
but they can get inside you
what happen to you here be for ever O'Brien have say
that be a true word
there be thing your own act from which you can never recover
something be kill in your breast burnt out cauterize out
he have see her he have even speak to her
there be no danger in it
he know as though instinctively that they now take almost no interest in his doing
he can have arrange to meet her a second time if either of them have want to
actually it be by chance that they have meet
it be in the park on a vile biting day in March when the earth be like iron and all the grass seem dead and there be not a bud anywhere except a few crocus which have push themselves up to be dismember by the wind
he be hurry along with frozen hand and water eye when he see her not ten metre away from him
it strike him at once that she have change in some ill-defined way
they almost pass one another without a sign then he turn and follow her not very eagerly
he know that there be no danger nobody will take any interest in him
she do not speak
she walk obliquely away across the grass as though try to get rid of him then seem to resign herself to have him at her side
presently they be in among a clump of ragged leafless shrub useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind
they halt
it be vilely cold
the wind whistle through the twig and fret the occasional dirty-looking crocus
he put his arm round her waist
there be no telescreen but there must be hide microphone besides they can be see
it do not matter nothing matter
they can have lie down on the ground and do that if they have want to
his flesh freeze with horror at the thought of it
she make no response whatever to the clasp of his arm she do not even try to disengage herself
he know now what have change in her
her face be sallow and there be a long scar partly hide by the hair across her forehead and temple but that be not the change
it be that her waist have grown thick and in a surprising way have stiffen
he remember how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he have help to drag a corpse out of some ruin and have be astonish not only by the incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle which make it seem more like stone than flesh
her body feel like that
it occur to him that the texture of her skin will be quite different from what it have once be
he do not attempt to kiss her nor do they speak
as they walk back across the grass she look directly at him for the first time
it be only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike
he wonder whether it be a dislike that come purely out of the past or whether it be inspire also by his bloated face and the water that the wind keep squeeze from his eye
they sit down on two iron chair side by side but not too close together
he see that she be about to speak
she move her clumsy shoe a few centimetre and deliberately crush a twig
her foot seem to have grow broad he notice
I betray you she say baldly
I betray you he say
she give him another quick look of dislike
sometimes she say they threaten you with something something you can+not stand up to can+not even think about
and then you say do+not do it to me do it to somebody else do it to so-and-so
and perhaps you must pretend afterwards that it be only a trick and that you just say it to make them stop and do+not really mean it
but that be+not true
at the time when it happen you do mean it
you think there be no other way of save yourself and you be quite ready to save yourself that way
you want it to happen to the other person
you do+not give a damn what they suffer
all you care about be yourself
all you care about be yourself he echo
and after that you do+not feel the same towards the other person any longer
no he say you do+not feel the same
there do not seem to be anything more to say
the wind plaster their thin overall against their body
almost at once it become embarrassing to sit there in silence besides it be too cold to keep still
she say something about catch her tube and stand up to go
we must meet again he say
yes she say we must meet again
he follow irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind her
they do not speak again
she do not actually try to shake him off but walk at just such a speed as to prevent his keep abreast of her
he have make up his mind that he will accompany her as far as the tube station but suddenly this process of trail along in the cold seem pointless and unbearable
he be overwhelm by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which have never seem so attractive as at this moment
he have a nostalgic vision of his corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin
above all it will be warm in there
the next moment not altogether by accident he allow himself to become separate from her by a small knot of people
he make a halfhearted attempt to catch up then slow down turn and make off in the opposite direction
when he have go fifty metre he look back
the street be not crowded but already he can not distinguish her
any one of a dozen hurry figure must have be hers
perhaps her thicken stiffen body be no longer recognizable from behind
at the time when it happen she have say you do mean it
he have mean it
he have not merely say it he have wish it
he have wish that she and not he shall be deliver over to the
something change in the music that trickle from the telescreen
a cracked and jeer note a yellow note come into it
and then perhaps it be not happen perhaps it be only a memory take on the semblance of sound a voice be sing
under the spread chestnut tree
I sell you and you sell me
the tear well up in his eye
a passing waiter notice that his glass be empty and come back with the gin bottle
he take up his glass and sniff at it
the stuff grow not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drink
but it have become the element he swim in
it be his life his death and his resurrection
it be gin that sink him into stupor every night and gin that revive him every morning
when he wake seldom before eleven hundred with gummed-up eyelid and fiery mouth and a back that seem to be broken it will have be impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it have not be for the bottle and teacup place beside the bed overnight
through the midday hour he sit with glazed face the bottle handy listen to the telescreen
from fifteen to closing-time he be a fixture in the chestnut tree
no one care what he do any longer no whistle wake him no telescreen admonish him
occasionally perhaps twice a week he go to a dusty forgotten-looking office in the ministry of truth and do a little work or what be call work
he have be appoint to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which have sprout from one of the innumerable committee deal with minor difficulty that arise in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the Newspeak dictionary
they be engage in produce something call a interim report but what it be that they be report on he have never definitely find out
it be something to do with the question of whether comma shall be place inside bracket or outside
there be four others on the committee all of them person similar to himself
there be day when they assemble and then promptly disperse again frankly admit to one another that there be not really anything to be do
but there be other day when they settle down to their work almost eagerly make a tremendous show of enter up their minute and draft long memorandum which be never finish when the argument as to what they be supposedly argue about grow extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling over definition enormous digression quarrel threat even to appeal to high authority
and then suddenly the life will go out of them and they will sit round the table look at one another with extinct eye like ghost fade at cock-crow
the telescreen be silent for a moment
Winston raise his head again
the bulletin
but no they be merely change the music
he have the map of Africa behind his eyelid
the movement of the army be a diagram a black arrow tear vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward across the tail of the first
as though for reassurance he look up at the imperturbable face in the portrait
be it conceivable that the second arrow do not even exist
his interest flag again
he drink another mouthful of gin pick up the white knight and make a tentative move
check
but it be evidently not the right move because
uncall a memory float into his mind
he see a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sit on the floor shake a dice-box and laugh excited
his mother be sit opposite him and also laugh
it must have be about a month before she disappear
it be a moment of reconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly be forget and his early affection for her have temporarily revive
he remember the day well a pelt drench day when the water stream down the window-pane and the light indoors be too dull to read by
the boredom of the two child in the dark cramped bedroom become unbearable
Winston whine and grizzle make futile demand for food fret about the room pull everything out of place and kick the wainscoting until the neighbour bang on the wall while the young child wail intermittently
in the end his mother say now be good and I will buy you a toy
a lovely toy you will love it and then she have go out in the rain to a little general shop which be still sporadically open nearby and come back with a cardboard box contain a outfit of snake and ladder
he can still remember the smell of the damp cardboard
it be a miserable outfit
the board be cracked and the tiny wooden dice be so ill-cut that they will hardly lie on their side
Winston look at the thing sulkily and without interest
but then his mother light a piece of candle and they sit down on the floor to play
soon he be wildly excited and shout with laughter as the tiddly-winks climb hopefully up the ladder and then come slither down the snake again almost to the starting-point
they play eight game win four each
his tiny sister too young to understand what the game be about have sit prop up against a bolster laugh because the others be laugh
for a whole afternoon they have all be happy together as in his early childhood
he push the picture out of his mind
it be a false memory
he be trouble by false memory occasionally
they do not matter so long as one know them for what they be
some thing have happen others have not happen
he turn back to the chessboard and pick up the white knight again
almost in the same instant it drop on to the board with a clatter
he have start as though a pin have run into him
a shrill trumpet-call have pierce the air
it be the bulletin
victory
it always mean victory when a trumpet-call precede the news
a sort of electric drill run through the cafe
even the waiter have start and prick up their ear
the trumpet-call have let loose a enormous volume of noise
already a excited voice be gabble from the telescreen but even as it start it be almost drown by a roar of cheering from outside
the news have run round the street like magic
he can hear just enough of what be issue from the telescreen to realize that it have all happen as he have foresee a vast seaborne armada have secretly assemble a sudden blow in the enemy have rear the white arrow tear across the tail of the black
fragment of triumphant phrase push themselves through the din vast strategic manoeuvre perfect co-ordination utter rout half a million prisoner complete demoralization control of the whole of Africa bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory great victory in human history victory victory victory
under the table Winston have foot make convulsive movement
he have not stir from his seat but in his mind he be run swiftly run he be with the crowd outside cheer himself deaf
he look up again at the portrait of big brother
the colossus that bestride the world
the rock against which the horde of Asia dash themselves in vain
he think how ten minute ago yes only ten minute there have still be equivocation in his heart as he wonder whether the news from the front will be of victory or defeat
ah it be more than a Eurasian army that have perish
much have change in him since that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable healing change have never happen until this moment
the voice from the telescreen be still pour forth its tale of prisoner and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside have die down a little
the waiter be turn back to their work
one of them approach with the gin bottle
Winston sit in a blissful dream pay no attention as his glass be fill up
he be not run or cheer any longer
he be back in the ministry of love with everything forgive his soul white as snow
he be in the public dock confess everything implicate everybody
he be walk down the white-tiled corridor with the feeling of walk in sunlight and a armed guard at his back
the longhoped-for bullet be enter his brain
he gaze up at the enormous face
forty year it have take him to learn what kind of smile be hide beneath the dark moustache
o cruel needless misunderstanding
o stubborn self-willed exile from the loving breast
two gin-scented tear trickle down the side of his nose
but it be all right everything be all right the struggle be finish
he have win the victory over himself
he love big brother
Newspeak be the official language of Oceania and have be devise to meet the ideological need of Ingsoc or English socialism
in the year 1984 there be not as yet anyone who use Newspeak as his sole means of communication either in speech or writing
the leading article in the Times be write in it but this be a tour_de_force which can only be carry out by a specialist
it be expect that Newspeak will have finally supersede oldspeak or standard English as we shall call it by about the year 2050
meanwhile it gain ground steadily all party member tend to use Newspeak word and grammatical construction more and more in their everyday speech
the version in use in 1984 and embody in the ninth and tenth edition of the Newspeak dictionary be a provisional one and contain many superfluous word and archaic formation which be due to be suppress later
it be with the final perfected version as embody in the eleventh edition of the dictionary that we be concern here
the purpose of Newspeak be not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habit proper to the devotee of Ingsoc but to make all other mode of thought impossible
it be intend that when Newspeak have be adopt once and for all and oldspeak forget a heretical thought that be a thought diverge from the principle of Ingsoc shall be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought be dependent on word
its vocabulary be so construct as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member can properly wish to express while exclude all other meaning and also the possibility of arrive at them by indirect method
this be do partly by the invention of new word but chiefly by eliminate undesirable word and by strip such word as remain of unorthodox meaning and so far as possible of all secondary meaning whatever
to give a single example
the word free still exist in Newspeak but it can only be use in such statement as this dog be free from louse or this field be free from weed
it can not be use in its old sense of politically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer exist even as concept and be therefore of necessity nameless
quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical word reduction of vocabulary be regard as a end in itself and no word that can be dispense with be allow to survive
Newspeak be design not to extend but to diminish the range of thought and this purpose be indirectly assist by cut the choice of word down to a minimum
Newspeak be found on the English language as we now know it though many Newspeak sentence even when not contain newly-created word will be barely intelligible to a english-speaker of our own day
Newspeak word be divide into three distinct class know as the a vocabulary the B vocabulary also call compound word and the c vocabulary
it will be simple to discuss each class separately but the grammatical peculiarity of the language can be deal with in the section devote to the a vocabulary since the same rule hold good for all three category
the a vocabulary
the a vocabulary consist of the word need for the business of everyday life for such thing as eating drinking work put on one have clothes go up and down stair ride in vehicle garden cooking and the like
it be compose almost entirely of word that we already possess word like hit run dog tree sugar house field but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their number be extremely small while their meaning be far more rigidly define
all ambiguity and shade of meaning have be purge out of them
so far as it can be achieve a Newspeak word of this class be simply a staccato sound express one clearly understood concept
it will have be quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purpose or for political or philosophical discussion
it be intend only to express simple purposive thought usually involve concrete object or physical action
the grammar of Newspeak have two outstanding peculiarity
the first of these be a almost complete interchangeability between different part of speech
any word in the language in principle this apply even to very abstract word such as if or when can be use either as verb noun adjective or adverb
between the verb and the noun form when they be of the same root there be never any variation this rule of itself involve the destruction of many archaic form
the word thought for example do not exist in Newspeak
its place be take by think which do duty for both noun and verb
no etymological principle be follow here in some case it be the original noun that be choose for retention in other case the verb
even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning be not etymologically connect one or other of them be frequently suppress
there be for example no such word as cut its meaning be sufficiently cover by the noun-verb knife
adjective be form by add the suffix ful to the noun-verb and adverb by add wise
thus for example speedful mean rapid and speedwise mean quickly
certain of our present-day adjective such as good strong big black soft be retain but their total number be very small
there be little need for them since almost any adjectival meaning can be arrive at by add ful to a noun-verb
none of the now-existing adverb be retain except for a very few already end in wise the wise termination be invariable
the word well for example be replace by goodwise
in addition any word this again apply in principle to every word in the language can be negative by add the affix un or can be strengthen by the affix plus or for still great emphasis doubleplus
thus for example uncold mean warm while pluscold and doublepluscold mean respectively very cold and superlatively cold
it be also possible as in present-day English to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affix such as ante post up down etc.
by such method it be found possible to bring about a enormous diminution of vocabulary
give for instance the word good there be no need for such a word as bad since the required meaning be equally well indeed better express by ungood
all that be necessary in any case where two word form a natural pair of opposite be to decide which of them to suppress
dark for example can be replace by unlight or light by undark accord to preference
the second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar be its regularity
subject to a few exception which be mention below all inflexion follow the same rule
thus in all verb the preterite and the past participle be the same and end in ed
the preterite of steal be stealed the preterite of think be think and so on throughout the language all such form as swim give bring speak take etc. be abolish
all plural be make by add s or es as the case must be
the plural of man ox life be man oxes life
comparison of adjective be invariably make by add er est good good good irregular form and the more most formation be suppress
the only class of word that be still allow to inflect irregularly be the pronoun the relative the demonstrative adjective and the auxiliary verb
all of these follow their ancient usage except that whom have be scrap as unnecessary and the shall shall tense have be drop all their use be cover by will and will
there be also certain irregularity in word-formation arise out of the need for rapid and easy speech
a word which be difficult to utter or be liable to be incorrectly hear be hold to be ipso_facto a bad word occasionally therefore for the sake of euphony extra letter be insert into a word or a archaic formation be retain
but this need make itself feel chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary
why so great a importance be attach to ease of pronunciation will be make clear later in this essay
the B vocabulary
the B vocabulary consist of word which have be deliberately construct for political purpose word that be to say which not only have in every case a political implication but be intend to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person use them
without a full understanding of the principle of Ingsoc it be difficult to use these word correctly
in some case they can be translate into oldspeak or even into word take from the a vocabulary but this usually demand a long paraphrase and always involve the loss of certain overtone
the B word be a sort of verbal shorthand often pack whole range of idea into a few syllable and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language
the B word be in all case compound word
they consist of two or more word or portion of word weld together in a easily pronounceable form
the result amalgam be always a noun-verb and inflect accord to the ordinary rule
to take a single example the word goodthink mean very roughly orthodoxy or if one choose to regard it as a verb to think in a orthodox manner
this inflect as follow noun-verb goodthink past tense and past participle goodthinked present participle good-thinking adjective goodthinkful adverb goodthinkwise verbal noun goodthinker
the B word be not construct on any etymological plan
the word of which they be make up can be any part of speech and can be place in any order and mutilate in any way which make them easy to pronounce while indicate their derivation
in the word crimethink thoughtcrime for instance the think come second whereas in thinkpol thought police it come first and in the latter word police have lose its second syllable
because of the great difficulty in secure euphony irregular formation be common in the B vocabulary than in the a vocabulary
for example the adjective form of Minitrue Minipax and Miniluv be respectively minitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely simply because trueful paxful and loveful be slightly awkward to pronounce
in principle however all B word can inflect and all inflect in exactly the same way
some of the B word have highly subtilized meaning barely intelligible to anyone who have not master the language as a whole
consider for example such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as oldthinker unbellyfeel Ingsoc
the short rendering that one can make of this in oldspeak will be those whose idea be form before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principle of English socialism
but this be not a adequate translation
to begin with in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quote above one will have to have a clear idea of what be mean by Ingsoc
and in addition only a person thoroughly ground in Ingsoc can appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel which imply a blind enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today or of the word oldthink which be inextricably mix up with the idea of wickedness and decadence
but the special function of certain Newspeak word of which oldthink be one be not so much to express meaning as to destroy them
these word necessarily few in number have have their meaning extend until they contain within themselves whole battery of word which as they be sufficiently cover by a single comprehensive term can now be scrap and forget
the great difficulty face the compiler of the Newspeak dictionary be not to invent new word but have invent them to make sure what they mean to make sure that be to say what range of word they cancel by their existence
as we have already see in the case of the word free word which have once bear a heretical meaning be sometimes retain for the sake of convenience but only with the undesirable meaning purge out of them
countless other word such as honour justice morality internationalism democracy science a religion have simply cease to exist
a few blanket word cover them and in cover them abolish them
all word group themselves round the concept of liberty and equality for instance be contain in the single word crimethink while all word group themselves round the concept of objectivity and rationalism be contain in the single word oldthink
great precision will have be dangerous
what be require in a party member be a outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who know without know much else that all nation other than his own worship false god
he do not need to know that these god be call baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and the like probably the less he know about them the better for his orthodoxy
he know jehovah and the commandment of jehovah he know therefore that all god with other name or other attribute be false god
in somewhat the same way the party member know what constitute right conduct and in exceedingly vague generalize term he know what kind of departure from it be possible
his sexual life for example be entirely regulate by the two Newspeak word sexcrime sexual immorality and goodsex chastity
sexcrime cover all sexual misdeed whatever
it cover fornication adultery homosexuality and other perversion and in addition normal intercourse practise for its own sake
there be no need to enumerate them separately since they be all equally culpable and in principle all punishable by death
in the c vocabulary which consist of scientific and technical word it must be necessary to give specialize name to certain sexual aberration but the ordinary citizen have no need of them
he know what be mean by goodsex that be to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose of beget child and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman all else be sexcrime
in Newspeak it be seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it be heretical beyond that point the necessary word be nonexistent
no word in the B vocabulary be ideologically neutral
a great many be euphemism
such word for instance as joycamp forced-labour camp or Minipax ministry of peace i.e. ministry of war mean almost the exact opposite of what they appear to mean
some word on the other hand display a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society
a example be prolefeed mean the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party hand out to the mass
other word again be ambivalent have the connotation good when apply to the party and bad when apply to its enemy
but in addition there be great number of word which at first sight appear to be mere abbreviation and which derive their ideological colour not from their meaning but from their structure
so far as it can be contrive everything that have or must have political significance of any kind be fit into the B vocabulary
the name of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public building be invariably cut down into the familiar shape that be a single easily pronounced word with the small numb of syllable that will preserve the original derivation
in the ministry of truth for example the record department in which Winston Smith work be call recdep the fiction department be call ficdep the teleprogrammes department be call teledep and so on
this be not do solely with the object of save time
even in the early decade of the twentieth century telescoped word and phrase have be one of the characteristic feature of political language and it have be notice that the tendency to use abbreviation of this kind be most marked in totalitarian country and totalitarian organization
example be such word as Nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop
in the beginning the practice have be adopt as it be instinctively but in Newspeak it be use with a conscious purpose
it be perceive that in thus abbreviate a name one narrow and subtly alter its meaning by cut out most of the association that will otherwise cling to it
the word communist international for instance call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flag barricade karl marx and the Paris commune
the word comintern on the other hand suggest merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine
it refer to something almost as easily recognize and as limited in purpose as a chair or a table
comintern be a word that can be utter almost without take thought whereas communist international be a phrase over which one be obliged to linger at least momentarily
in the same way the association call up by a word like Minitrue be few and more controllable than those call up by ministry of truth
this account not only for the habit of abbreviate whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that be take to make every word easily pronounceable
in Newspeak euphony outweigh every consideration other than exactitude of meaning
regularity of grammar be always sacrifice to it when it seem necessary
and rightly so since what be require above all for political purpose be short clip word of unmistakable meaning which can be utter rapidly and which rouse the minimum of echo in the speaker have mind
the word of the B vocabulary even gain in force from the fact that nearly all of them be very much alike
almost invariably these word goodthink Minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp Ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless others be word of two or three syllable with the stress distribute equally between the first syllable and the last
the use of them encourage a gabble style of speech at once staccato and monotonous
and this be exactly what be aim at
the intention be to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness
for the purpose of everyday life it be no doubt necessary or sometimes necessary to reflect before speak but a party member call upon to make a political or ethical judgement shall be able to spray forth the correct opinion as automatically as a machine gun spray forth bullet
his train fit him to do this the language give him a almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the word with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which be in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc assist the process still further
so do the fact of have very few word to choose from
relative to our own the Newspeak vocabulary be tiny and new way of reduce it be constantly be devise
Newspeak indeed differ from most all other language in that its vocabulary grow small instead of large every year
each reduction be a gain since the small the area of choice the small the temptation to take thought
ultimately it be hope to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involve the high brain centre at all
this aim be frankly admit in the Newspeak word duckspeak mean to quack like a duck
like various other word in the B vocabulary duckspeak be ambivalent in meaning
provided that the opinion which be quack out be orthodox one it imply nothing but praise and when the Times refer to one of the orator of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it be pay a warm and valued compliment
the c vocabulary
the c vocabulary be supplementary to the others and consist entirely of scientific and technical term
these resemble the scientific term in use today and be construct from the same root but the usual care be take to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meaning
they follow the same grammatical rule as the word in the other two vocabulary
Very few of the c word have any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech
any scientific worker or technician can find all the word he need in the list devote to his own speciality but he seldom have more than a smattering of the word occur in the other list
only a very few word be common to all list and there be no vocabulary express the function of science as a habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particular branch
there be indeed no word for science any meaning that it can possibly bear be already sufficiently cover by the word Ingsoc
from the foregoing account it will be see that in Newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinion above a very low level be well-nigh impossible
it be of course possible to utter heresy of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy
it will have be possible for example to say big brother be ungood
but this statement which to a orthodox ear merely convey a self-evident absurdity can not have be sustain by reasoned argument because the necessary word be not available
idea inimical to Ingsoc can only be entertain in a vague wordless form and can only be name in very broad term which lump together and condemn whole group of heresy without define them in do so
one can in fact only use Newspeak for unorthodox purpose by illegitimately translate some of the word back into oldspeak
for example all man be equal be a possible Newspeak sentence but only in the same sense in which all man be redhaired be a possible oldspeak sentence
it do not contain a grammatical error but it express a palpable untruth i.e. that all man be of equal size weight or strength
the concept of political equality no longer exist and this secondary meaning have accordingly be purge out of the word equal
in 1984 when oldspeak be still the normal means of communication the danger theoretically exist that in use Newspeak word one must remember their original meaning
in practice it be not difficult for any person well ground in doublethink to avoid do this but within a couple of generation even the possibility of such a lapse will have vanish
a person grow up with Newspeak as his sole language will no more know that equal have once have the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free have once mean intellectually free than for instance a person who have never hear of chess will be aware of the secondary meaning attach to queen and rook
there will be many crime and error which it will be beyond his power to commit simply because they be nameless and therefore unimaginable
and it be to be foresee that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristic of Newspeak will become more and more pronounced its word grow few and few their meaning more and more rigid and the chance of put them to improper use always diminish
when oldspeak have be once and for all supersede the last link with the past will have be sever
history have already be rewrite but fragment of the literature of the past survive here and there imperfectly censor and so long as one retain one have knowledge of oldspeak it be possible to read them
in the future such fragment even if they chance to survive will be unintelligible and untranslatable
it be impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either refer to some technical process or some very simple everyday action or be already orthodox goodthinkful will be the Newspeak expression in tendency
in practice this mean that no book write before approximately 1960 can be translate as a whole
pre-revolutionary literature can only be subject to ideological translation that be alteration in sense as well as language
take for example the well-known passage from the declaration of independence
we hold these truth to be self-evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
that to secure these right government be institute among man derive their power from the consent of the govern
that whenever any form of government become destructive of those end it be the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government
it will have be quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while keep to the sense of the original
the near one can come to do so will be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink
a full translation can only be a ideological translation whereby jefferson have word will be change into a panegyric on absolute government
a good deal of the literature of the past be indeed already be transform in this way
consideration of prestige make it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figure while at the same time bring their achievement into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc
various writer such as shakespeare milton Swift byron dickens and some others be therefore in process of translation when the task have be complete their original writing with all else that survive of the literature of the past will be destroy
these translation be a slow and difficult business and it be not expect that they will be finish before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century
there be also large quantity of merely utilitarian literature indispensable technical manual and the like that have to be treat in the same way
it be chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeak have be fix for so late a date as 2050
