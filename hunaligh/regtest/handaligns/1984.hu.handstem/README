====
Notes for users:


Data obtained from the English-Hungarian parallel Multext-East "1984" corpus.

.sen files contain the sentence-level information of that corpus, excluding word-level information and paragraph structure.

.pre files (unlike in ../1984.hu) contain tokenization and word stems that were manually obtained (well, were partly manually verified) by the Multext-East people.
